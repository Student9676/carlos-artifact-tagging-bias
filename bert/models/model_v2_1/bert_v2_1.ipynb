      "\n",
      "As early as the Bronze Age, Mycenaean Greeks had traveled westwards to South Italy and Sicily to trade with the native populations.  Beginning in the eighth century B.C., mainland and eastern Greeks returned to Italy to establish permanent colonies, driven by a desire for land, resources, and trade.  The Greek colonists came from such areas as Eretria, Sparta, Corinth, and Rhodes; the cities they founded (including Syracuse, Paestum, and Taranto) rose to prominence in the Archaic and Classical periods.  In many cases, the political influence and economic prosperity of the colonies came to exceed that of their mainland counterparts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, the art of the South Italian and Sicilian colonies was closely linked to the art of mainland and East Greece; with the immigration of Greek artists and the steady flow of Greek imports fueling the adoption of mainland fashions, the art was translated into local colonial art.  In time, however, the various cities and regions of South Italy and Sicily began to develop their own distinctive artistic styles, independently of each other and of the motherland. \n",
      "\n",
      "An example of the evolution of a South Italian art form can be found in the production of pottery.  In the Archaic and Early Classical periods, imports from Corinth, Athens, Etruria, and East Greece satisfied the need for decorated clay vessels, with minimal manufacture by local artists.  From the mid-fifth century B.C., however, the establishment of local red-figure pottery workshops instigated a rise in the creation and quality of western colonial wares.  Throughout the fourth century B.C., when the political prominence of Athens and the trade of Athenian vases had begun to wane, the South Italian pottery industry flourished; trade of these locally made vessels largely centered on Italy itself, in the colonies and in neighboring Etruria. \n",
      "\n",
      "South Italian red-figure pottery may be classified into five major fabrics (materials of manufacture): Lucanian, Apulian, Campanian, Paestan, Sicilian.  Each of these is based in a particular region and involves a unique style.  Apulian pottery, for example, is characterized by ornate compositions and a dramatic use of color (5, 8).  The subjects of these vessels ranged from conventional scenes of mythology and daily life to more western themes, including funerary and theatrical imagery.  South Italian red-figure pottery continued to be produced until the late fourth century B.C., when it was superseded by a taste for more austere black glaze ware (1, 4, 6). The decoration and technique of black glaze vessels was based upon that of more expensive metal vases. \n",

      "The servant (on the right), recognizable from her facial features as African, carries offerings for the tomb: a basket of sashes balanced on her head and an alabastron (perfume vase) in her hand. The term “white-ground” refers to vases on which a white slip is used as a background. Here the figures are only partly rendered by using glaze outlines, while drapery and other details would have been added in paint after firing. The colors added after firing (red, blue, yellow, purple, and green) often fade with time, but traces of their presence can still be made out. The marble relief probably showed a woman approaching an altar to worship. Her raised hand may have held a sprig rather than a phiale. The stiff, exaggerated drapery indicates that this is a Roman “archaistic” version of fifth century Greek originals; the red-figure lekythos and black-glazed oinochoe displayed nearby are modest examples. 1.

Lent by Lewis M. Dubroff. 119C - Greek Pottery of South Italy and Sicily As early as the Bronze Age, Mycenaean Greeks had traveled westwards to South Italy and Sicily to trade with the native populations. Beginning in the eighth century B.C., mainland and eastern Greeks returned to Italy to establish permanent colonies, driven by a desire for land, resources, and trade. The Greek colonists came from such areas as Eretria, Sparta, Corinth, and Rhodes; the cities they founded (including Syracuse, Paestum, and Taranto) rose to prominence in the Archaic and Classical periods. In many cases, the political influence and economic prosperity of the colonies came to exceed that of their mainland counterparts. Originally, the art of the South Italian and Sicilian colonies was closely linked to the art of mainland and East Greece, with the immigration of Greek artists and the steady flow of Greek imports fueling the adoption of mainland fashions, translated into local colonial art. In time, however, the various cities and regions of South Italy and Sicily began to develop their own distinctive artistic styles, independently of each other and of the motherland.

Dionysos was also worshipped in mystery cults, which promised a blessed afterlife to his initiates. \n",

He was first portrayed by artists as an older, bearded man (2), only acquiring the image of a beardless youth after the mid-fifth century B.C. (3).

Here, in a typically carefree mood, he plays upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention.

The symposium  was an important social occasion, bringing friends together not only to drink, but also talk, read poetry, sing, play musical instruments and games, and perform religious rituals. On the symposium cup displayed here, for instance, one young man holds out a libation bowl (phiale), several others play kottabos, a popular game in which a player, holding up a cup, flings a few drops of wine at a target.

On this cup, several of the figures play kottabos, a popular game of skill in which a player, holding up a kylix, flings a few drops of wine toward a target. One young man holds out a libation bowl (phiale); it was customary at a symposion to dedicate the wine to the gods by pouring libations out in their honor. Above the heads of the men, as if hanging on the wall, the artist has depicted objects associated with the symposion, including drinking cups, baskets, musical instruments, and walking sticks which suggest the participants prominent social status. On the interior of the cup, a small three-legged table stands near two other men, with extra wreaths draped over it and a pair of boots beneath.

Herakles was renowned for his drinking in excess.  Both Dionysos, the giver of wine, and Herakles, the great imbiber, were popular subjects for the ancient Greek artist, particularly on vessels associated with the symposium (Greek drinking party), kraters (2, 3) for mixing wine, drinking cups of various styles (1, 4, 9), and bronze statuettes (7). \n",

The elder satyr pours the liquid from an oinochoe (small pitcher) into Herakles’ kantharos (drinking cup), such as the one in this case (1).

Dionysiac experiences, ecstasy and enthusiasm.  The Greek word ekstasis, literally means \"to be beside yourself\" or \"to step outside of yourself.\"  In such a state one becomes an empty vessel into which the god may come.  This is enthousiasmos, or literally \"allowing the god to enter into you,\" and so transform you.  The god is embodied in the wine, and once Dionysos is inside a human body, individuals feel transformed into something other than what they normally are.  Likewise, in the theatrical experience participants give up their normal identity and by wearing masks -the emblem of the god-are transformed into something different. \n",

      "115A - SYMPOSIA AND FEASTING IN ANCIENT GREECE \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In ancient Greece, the symposion, or drinking party, served an important social function, providing upper-class men with a private forum in which they could discuss ideas, enjoy the company of friends, and indulge in the pleasures of wine, sex, and song.  At the symposion, revelers reclined on couches while partaking of wine.  Entertainment could include dancing girls (1, 6).  Symposiasts could provide their own amusement by playing musical instruments, reciting poetry, or playing drinking games.  Although an occasion of fun and revelry, the symposion was also a highly ritualized event, with complex rules of etiquette to be followed by the participants.  The symposion was for example presided over by a single chosen leader, the basileus (king), and involved such ceremonies as libations for gods and heroes, acts of ritual cleansing, and the distribution of wreaths.  In a related event, the komos, revelers would form lively and often rowdy processions leading from one symposion to the next (2). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, was at the center of the symposion.  In large vessels known as kraters (1, 3), the highly potent wine was mixed with water, a sign of civilized culture; the Greeks believed that only barbarians drank undiluted wine.  Symposiasts drank the wine from drinking cups of various shapes, including skyphoi (4, 10) and kantharoi (9).  Not surprisingly, the vases associated with the symposion could themselves be decorated with symposion or komos scenes, either mythological or mortal in nature (1, 3, 4, 10). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as mortals enjoyed the tradition of the symposion, so too gods and heroes partook of wine and the feast in the realm of Greek myth.  The semi-divine hero Herakles was particularly fond of drinking (3).  On the Sicilian calyx krater by the Chequer Painter (so called because of the chequered pattern normally found on his vessels), Herakles relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his thirst.  The elder satyr pours the wine from an oinochoe (small pitcher) into HeraklesÕ kantharos. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The god most associated with the symposion, however, was Dionysos, who acted as the god of wine, drama, and ecstatic experience.  Just as Dionysos himself had many identities, both positive and negative, so too wine was viewed as a transformative substance, with both positive and negative qualities, itself embodying the god.  Predictably, Dionysos appears frequently in images of the symposion and komos (1, 4, 10), portrayed by artists in the Archaic and Early Classical periods as an older, bearded man (10) and in later times as a beardless youth (1). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In art and myth, Dionysos was joined by members of his thiasos, his attendants, a wild and uninhibited group that included such characters as satyrs, men with horse features (7, 10) and ecstatic maenads, Dionysos' female companions (1, 6, 10).  Silenos, a jolly older satyr known for his love of women and revelry, also appears in Dionysiac imagery (8).  In addition, the half-man, half-goat Pan, a nature god of Arcadia, was associated with Dionysos (5).  The statuette depicts Pan in a carefree mood, playing upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the symposion, the feast was a vital institution in ancient Greece, fulfilling both a social and a sacred role.  The custom of the public feast was linked to the rituals of animal sacrifice; after the beasts were slaughtered, the cooked meat was shared among participants and spectators of the rite.  Because the feast symbolized community and piety, it became a frequent motif in art, particularly on funerary and votive reliefs.  In this marble relief (2), a bearded hero holds a drinking horn (rhyton) and reclines as a woman, probably the man's wife, sits nearby and a naked serving boy draws wine from a vessel.  An adorant approaches from the left, and the architectural frame of the relief suggests a small building or shrine.  A partially preserved inscription recording the dedication runs along the architrave of the shrine. \n",

      "118C - The Power of Wine\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, served as a refreshment as well as a transformative substance. Its altering power, extolled by the followers of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine, was recognized as postitive and negative. It could transform the imbiber (drinker) into a state of exultation and freedom from cares, enthousiasmos, or it could turn destructive, changing an heroic character such as Herakles into a befuddled fool, causing him to blunder in the face of serious matters like death. Herakles was renowned for his drinking in excess. Both Dionysos, the giver of wine, and Herakles, the great imbiber, were popular subjects for the ancient Greek artist, particularly on vessels associated with the symposium (Greek drinking party), kraters (3,8) for mixing wine, and drinking cups of various styles (1,2,9).\n",
      "\n",
      "Herakles is seen as the central figure in the calyx krater (8) by the Chequer Painter, so-called because of his penchant for a chequered pattern on his vessels. The semi-divine hero relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his desire for wine. The elder satyr pouts the liquid from an oinochoe (smal pitcher) into Herakles' kantharos (drinking cup), such as the one in this case (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos' role as the god of wine was parallel to his role as the god of drama. These roles were closely linked in the two basic and complementary Dionysiac experiences, ecstacy and enthusiasm. The Greek word ekstasis literally means \"to be beside youself\" or \"to step outside of yourself.\" In such a state one becomes an empty vessel into which the god may come. This is enthousiasmos, or literally \"allowing the god to enter into you,\" and so transform you. The god is embodied in the wine, and once Dionysos is inside a human body, individuals feel transformed into something other than what they normally are. Likewise, in the theatrical experience participants give up their normal identity and by wearing masks - the emblem of the god - are transformed into something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos as the god of wine and drama as well as his other aspects were celebrated in public festivals throughout the Greek world, from the mainland to the colonies, from South Italy to the Black Sea. Dionysos was also worshiped in mystery cults, which promised a blessed afterlife to his initiates. Both because of his importance in Greek thought and the richness of stories associated with his revels, Dionysos appeared repeatedly in Greek art in various media, including vases, sculpture, and coins, from the early sixth century B.C.  onwards. He was first portrayed by artists as an older, bearded man (2, 9), only acquiring the image of a beardless youth after the mid-fifth century B.C. (3,8). Various symbols associated with Dionysos in art included the rhyton (drinking horn) (9), the kantharos (1), the skyphos (drinking cup) (2,9), masks, grapevines, and the thyrsos (fennel wand crowned with ivy and grapes).\n",
      "\n",
      "The attendants of Dionysos, known as his thiasos, occur in Greek art on their own or accompanying the god. They were a wild and uninhibited group, including such characters as satyrs, men with horse features (2,5) and ecstatic maenads, Dionysos' female companions (2,3,7). Other minor gods could join Dionysos in his adventures, among them Pan, the half-man, half-goat god of nature (4), and Silenos, a jolly old fat man known for his love of wine, women, and song (6). These characters frequently are pictured as party revellers, participating in great drunken fests that have come to be known as Bacchanals, after the Roman name for Dionysos, Bacchus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos, serving in a triple capacity as god of wine, drama, and the mysteries, was a favorite subject of South Italian vase painters. On 3, a krater by the Creusa Painter, the god is reclining on a couch as a maenad dances before him. He holds a skyphos for wine and a lyre; other Dionysiac symbols, including a tamborine and thyrsos, surround him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statuette (4) depicts the half-man, half-goat, Pan, a nature god of Arcadia who became associated with Dionysos in the fifth century B.C. The son of Hermes, Pan was the patron of shepherds and goatherds; his realm was the forests and mountains of the wild. Here, in a typically carefree mood, he plays upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention. On the rare occasions when Pan was unhappy, he could be heard screaming from mountain caves; the fear this inspired in passerby became known as \"panic.\"\n",

On the roll lintel, the name Tebash is also written, and down the left side, over an image of his wife, is written,¿The lady Merut.¿ Mastaba tombs housed the burials of entire families and could be expanded by later generations. Burial chambers were carved into the earth below the mastaba and were reached by vertical shafts that cut through the body of the structure itself. The tombs of even the most wealthy were often sparsely furnished with only a headrest, a rectangular coffin, pottery vessels, and offerings of food. 1. False Door of Tebash and his Wife. Egypt, Giza.

      "The Near East During the Neolithic Period (ca 8500-4300 BC)  During the 4000 years of the Neolithic period, people in the Near East introduced changes that had far-reaching consequences for the development of civilization.  This period saw certain populations change their method of subsistence from hunting and gathering to food production.  Several areas of the Near East offered ideal conditions for the introduction of agriculture: a mild climate, the existence of several species of wild grains which flourished on the mountain slopes, and a water supply which could be dammed or drained from streams or marshes.  The agricultural revolution and the domestication of animals developed along with the construction of permanent settlements with substantial brick and stone architecture for private and public buildings.  With the inevitable growth of settled populations came the introduction of specialized craft trades and technological innovations with fulfilled the needs of newly organized, self-sustaining communities.\n",
      "The important developments of the Neolithic period are well represented by the early settlements at Jericho in the Levant, Catal Huyuk in Anatolia, and Tell es Sawwan in northern Mesopotamia.

These major constructions, dating back to ca. 8000 BC, predate other public works found in the Near East by over a thousand years and signal a community that was highly organized for its time.\n",
      "The evidence from Neolithic Jericho reflects the population's change from hunting and gathering to herding domesticated goats and sheep and farming, as evidenced by charred grain found at the site (1).  Tools and weapons used for agriculture and hunting purposes were made primarily from stone and included sickle blades, knives, scrapers, and arrowheads.  Stone grinders, querns, and pestles (2-8) were used to prepare flour and a variety of stone and bone tools, polishing stones (9,10), awls (11), borers and scrapers were utilized for sewing, weaving, leatherworking, basketry and other crafts.

      "Costa Rica and Panamá Compared\n",
      "In antiquity the distinction between “Costa Rica” and “Panamá” did not exist. However, chiefdoms do differ one to the next and even close neighbors can be distinguished by their particular artistic choices. Thus, the art of central and northern Costa Rica is quite\n",
      "distinct from that of central and western Panama.\n",
      "An obvious element differentiating Panamanian art is the unique purple slip (liquid clay colored with mineral pigments), best seen in 7. In addition, the pedestal plate form (5, 9), in which a tall tapering stand elevates a slightly concave plate, is also characteristic. They may\n",
      "evoke the natural shape of mushrooms, some of which have concave caps, and many of which produce visions. Interestingly, one of the pervasive effects of sacred mushrooms is seeing very small spirit beings; perhaps the miniature pedestal plates reflect this. The bases of plates often have snake-like diamond patterning, while the large plate (5) depicts crocodile/jaguars in almond-shaped zones. These fantastical animals face two directions, so one is perpetually upside down. All these features reflect shamanic principles: the seeing of snakes everywhere, combining of animal spirits, shamans inverting on the Other Side, and everything spinning during visions.\n",
      "The Costa Rican bowl (12) shows two heads on a splayed body, a similar inversion. Such tripod forms (8, 12) are much more common in Costa Rican art. While not always the case, Costa Rican art tends to be more sculptural—the two crab images display this, 8 being Costa Rican and 7 Panamanian, as do miniature vessels (9–12).\n",
      "Finally, Panamanian can be more abstract than neighboring styles: the miniature vessel (10) displays tiny almond-shaped patterns like those in 5, inside of which are the essential curves of the crocodile/jaguars. Shorthand and reductive, like the concentric circles of the crab’s back in 7, Panamanian styles avoid the detail packed into thed iminutive Costa Rican figure (11).\n",
      "Chiefdoms encourage artistic individuality, since leaders keep power only by persuasion. Art serves to display wealth, control over the most inventive artists, and the ability to trade with other elites by collecting exotic styles. Competition in the social realm leads to the same in the artistic, so the tiniest miniatures, the most elaborately painted vessels, or the most unusual slip colors aggrandize both makers and owners.\n",

      "The Human Body Transformed  \n",
      "\n",
      "Some images of humans are just that; however, a large number of ancient American artworks show humans transforming into animals, a central tenet of the religious complex known as shamanism. The experience of transformation results from rhythmic drumming (3), rattling (9, 10), or taking a mind-altering substance, such as hallucinogenic snuff (4, 5). These methods, along with blood loss and sensory or sleep deprivation, induce similar colorful and fantastical visions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Such visions characteristically include snakes (2), jaguars (3, 8), toads (6, 7), birds (11) and crocodiles (12). The snake image protruding from the mace head (2) can be seen as animal from the side and human from the front, an apt way for the artist to portray the dual existence of the shaman. Another way to depict two states of being is to put them side by side (8), with the spotted cat on the right and the human on the left. The human has wings and a beak to show that it is a flying shaman. Even more ingenious, 11 shows the bird's wings as a cape tied in front so as to portray the human in bird form. Similarly, 12 has a human body and a crocodilian head, with a long, up-curled snout. The head, sprouting horns or perhaps hallucinogenic mushrooms, serves as the detachable lid.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the duality of images and the strong emphasis on the head, the body part from which visions are seen, are taken to an extreme. Two-headed figures are common in shamanic art (1, 6, 7). The figure in 1 may be transforming into a double-headed crab to show a person simultaneously human (one head) and something else (the other head). Some vessels themselves are paired, like the matched bowls (6, 7), each with appliquéd striped people alternating with double-headed ones. The stripes associate the figures with the toad, which can be a source of potent hallucinogens. Perhaps the single-headed figures are the \"before\" and the double-headed ones the \"after\" in a transformative sequence. Such bowls may themselves have  contained mind-altering substances.   \n",

Thibadeau. \"For I am the Black Jaguar\" gallery label: Upside Down and Spinning “I saw an image of the Great Spiral and had the physical sensation of moving within it. The images, colors, and depth intensified until I was totally within the Spiral. I felt a knowing that God was there, teaching me my place on the Spiral.” Anonymous Ancient American cosmology features distinct planes of existence: a limited terrestrial surface sandwiched between vast realms on the Other Side, the Underworld below and the celestial above. The Underworld was conceived of as a reverse or mirror image of this world, and as a dark, chaotic, challenging, and creative place. Shamans during their visionary journeys freely visit the entire cosmos; in art they are usually shown flying through the celestial and traversing the Underworld, often positioned upside down in keeping with its inverting nature. The jaguar on the base of 1 is shown inverted, at least from a terrestrial point of view. On the vessel’s lower body is a twisted vine pattern, referring to the sacred plant Banisteriopsis caapi, therefore the jaguar is likely a shaman’s transformed self. The super-human abilities of shamans also include being in two places at once—both in their body on earth and not in their body in the Underworld (any seeming impossibility is rendered possible in trance consciousness). This paradox is embraced in 2, in which the figure simultaneously has a right side up and an upside down head coming off a single body. Trance entails dual consciousness, the visionary remains aware of the terrestrial while discovering the otherworldly; this is aptly captured in a two-headed shaman. Spinning is a type of repeating inversion and constitutes a very characteristic experience of visions. The shaman dizzyingly turns in space and what is being seen likewise spins around and around. Artistic compositions echo this type of trance movement by rotating a motif, such as a large reptilian eye (4) or incoherent bird parts and abstract shapes (3). Losing the cohesive reading is part of the message; this models visionary inversion for the viewer of the piece, transporting the audience to the visionary reaches of the cosmos. 1.

      "The Aztecs are the most famous of the ancient American peoples, here represented by an earspool (1), a miniature mask (2), a lip plug or labret (3), and five spindle whorls (4-8). Turquoise (1) was a valued blue-green material imported from far away in what is now the southwestern U.S. The small mask is an Aztec copy of an earlier type from Teotihuacan. The Aztecs modeled their work after this earlier style copying it, as well as collecting it, to place as offerings underneath their pyramids. The lip plug is carved from obsidian and would have been worn through the skin below the lower lip; the larger back flange kept it in position. Originally this piece probably had a gold sheet metal cover on the front part.\n",

      "Aztec males were highly adorned, not only with jewelry but also with feathers and fine cotton textiles. The women made cloth, first spinning the cotton with the aid of spindle whorls (4-8). A long wooden stick, the spindle, had a small disk, the whorl, threaded onto it to hold the thread as it was twisted and wound around the spindle. These whorls have intricate designs on them: flowers (4, 5; art was called \"flower and song\" in the Aztec language) and solar disks as on the Calendar Stone (6-8).\n",

      "One example of this cross-cultural influence is commonly known as Tell el-Yehudia ware, after a site in the Egyptian Delta. This vessel type evolved from small piriform, or pear-shaped juglets that originated in the Levant and were copied in Egypt in a black polished version incised with patterns of white-filled dots or lines. Some vessels of this type also show Aegean decorative motifs, such as the running spiral or Near Eastern motifs of men mastering animals.\n",

      "The Levant: Bronze-Iron Ages (ca. 3300-586 BC) The material culture of the Levant illustrates the region's important role as a bridge between Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and other areas of the Near East.  Direct and indirect contacts with these cultures influences much of the history and cultural development of the Levant.  The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan.\n",
      "1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired.  The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving.  Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2).  This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan.\n",
      "304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter's wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes.  Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. \n",
      "5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean.  ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters.  Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware  Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline.\n",
      "8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age.  Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles.  These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles.\n",
      "10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age.  Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris.  Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin.  Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant.\n",
      "18.  This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age.  The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes.

      "14-15.  These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan.  At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture.  Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire.  Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period.  A large proportion of the pottery (17) was simply painted in a fashion local to the region and northern Arabia.\n",

      "contacts with these cultures influences much of the history and cultural development of the Levant. The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan. 1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired. The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving. Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2). This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan. 304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter's wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes. Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. 5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean. ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters. Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline. 8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age. Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles. These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles. 10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age. Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris. Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin. Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant. 18. This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age. The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes. Used as cult objects, these figurines were a schematic representation of a female deity and throne and reflect a Mycenaean religious heritage that was preserved by the Philistines. 14-15. These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah,\n",

Permanent collection gallery: The Human-Feline Connection On the other side of the large head vessel (1) and on the head of the tiny flute (2) is a jaguar (or at least a cat, since 2 does not indicate spots). This encapsulates the widespread ancient American belief that there is an animal side to the human form, called in Mesoamerica the way [why] or the nagual [nah-wah]. Shamans transform into their animal spirit during ritual trances, and the jaguar is the most prestigious way of all, since the jaguar is the king of the jungle, the river, and the plains. It is no coincidence that the animal is depicted as the Other Side of the human and vice versa; this was one of the favored ways artists used to show the interconnectedness of two aspects of one being. Another was to place a cat right on the head, the place where the shaman?s visions take him into his animal being. Many ancient Costa Rican sculptures have an \"alter ego,\" sometimes a bird or a reptile, on the human figures. 1. Effigy Head Vessel.

      "Musical Instruments of Ancient Costa Rica\n",
      "Music is ubiquitous cross-culturally and musical instruments often are highly elaborated for ritual use. In ancient Costa Rica objects illustrate music and dance (5, the men play flutes, the women dance) and actual instruments include flutes (1–3, 5), rattles (6, 8, 10, 11) and drums (7). A piece may perform several functions, such as a vessel with rattling legs (9) or flutes with extra suspension holes for wear as pendants (1, 4). During rituals a sound-producing pot or necklace becomes activated so as to contact the spirits or induce trance (the rhythmic repetition of drumbeats or rattles changes human brainwaves). Imagery such as jaguars on the top of a person’s head or a drum (2, 7) suggests how music can cause a shaman to become a powerful animal-self during trance states.\n",
      "Musical instruments derive from and mirror natural sounds: clay rattles echo gourds (10, 11), which rattle when the Cucurbita seeds dry and rustle inside the hard husk. Gourds’ bulbous bodies and curved stems are naturalistically rendered, and holes originally pierced in gourds likewise allow the sound of interior rattle balls to sound louder. Animals’ noises, from the snuffling of coatis (Nasua nasua, raccoon-like foragers) (8) to the croaking of toads (9), are another inspiration for rattles that take effigy form. Birdcalls (3), the chirping of bats (4), and even the squeals of armadillos (1) are appropriately embodied in flutes. The artist of the bat flute cleverly designed it so that the animal stands upright as a necklace, but has to be inverted to make sound—acknowledging that bats only make sounds\n",
      "audible to humans when they are roosting upside down.\n",
      "These compositions reach beyond the sounds and appearances of the terrestrial world, however, when they combine human with transformative animal or sacred plant. The bird flute (3) displays several human features: almond eyes, ears as well as tufts of feathers, and, most tellingly, a cape tied around the neck and patterned on the back. It is therefore not simply a bird, but a shaman in bird form. The effigy flute with the jaguar on the head is equally non-representational, placing the most revered animal-self on the fontanel, still today associated with transformation and visionary experience. Another human effigy (6)—which illustrates a slit drum like 7, but is a rattle—wears a mushroom cap, becoming a sacred plant that causes visions. His eyes are round like an animal’s, his fancy necklace bespeaks his high status, and his drum/rattle body produces the trance-inducing sounds. Thus, this diminutive work of art becomes a complex shamanic ensemble in which separate categories of person, plant, body, and instrument evaporate. Music in the ancient Americas stood at the nexus of the natural and the supernatural, powerfully uniting the cosmic realms.\n",

      "\"Music was of the highest importance in ancient American cultures, most probably because its strong yet ethereal nature was thought to reach the celestial realms of the spirits.  Rituals involved the playing of percussion and wind instruments, principally rattles and flutes, such as this beautiful bat effigy one.  This flute has four holes on the back, its subsequent range of notes distinguishing it from a simple whistle.  It has been played by Antonio Zepeda, who has made it his life's work to perform original music on ancient American instruments, and on it he produced transcendently clear high notes.    Not only a musical instrument, the flute achieves a charming and quite evocative image of a bat. The characteristic upturned nose represents a type of leaf-nosed bat, such as the vampire bat common in Costa Rica. Suspension holes through the neck enable the bat flute to be worn upright as a necklace. However, one of the most intriguing things about this piece is that in order to be played it must be upturned, so that it then mimics the upside down position taken by an actual bat in a cave.  Not accidental, such design choices are common in the ancient American aesthetic system in which emphasis is placed on the essence of a subject.  This approach does not preclude realistic elements, however; for instance, the chocolate brown slip paint with dotted texture clearly evokes the bat's velvety color and texture.   \"\n",

      "The famous \"Ulua marbles\" (10) from Honduras are unique in the ancient Americas. As the only source for marble south of Georgia, in ancient times the Ulua Valley had at least ten quarries for the distinctive pink-veined marble. Scientific tests have pinpointed a quarry in the south end of the valley as the one used for this piece. The design features snake heads in profile, their swirling profusion perhaps symbolic of shamanic visions; the feline handles suggest the shaman's typical animal self. Ceramic cylinder vessels (14) may have provided the original form for the highly prized marbles or may imitate higher-status marble wares. Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture. Honduran artists took the dancing figures and glyphs of Maya vessels and transformed them into repetitive graphic designs (12-14). Non-Maya Hondurans seemed to favor references to prestigious exotica over faithful renditions of  Maya art. A subject such as fishing cormorants may look more Maya (15) or less so (11), showing that Honduran artists exercised considerable artistic freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human figurines (4, 5) display elaborate headdresses and jewelry. Blue paint (traces remain on the left side of the headdress in 5) suggests that colorful clothing and body paint were also common. Stamps covered with pigments, being slightly concave, transfer designs well to a rounded human body. Frontal figures (9), trios of swinging monkeys (8), or pairs of jaguar-humans (6, 7) probably represented a person's animal self in the shamanic religious orientation of the ancient Americas.\n",

She made the important point that water birds--non-naturalistic hybrids, appear on all phases of Ulua-Yojoa-Comayagua wares; i.e., early-middle-late.

The black slip probably reinforce the connection of the diving water birds on this vessel   with the underworld.          Bibliography: H. and B.C., pp. 258, 258-59, 262; and Joyce.        Note: introduction of Copador, c. 700 C.E., is in the literature, and has been connected to the demise   of 18-Rabbit, and hence a reconfiguring of Cop?n's system of government and the re-establishment   of ties with peoples to the east and south.

Also, \"\"the high sheen of the pot's surface is quite common on vessels pulled from the ground and is probably a natural waxy substance.\"\" At this same meeting RSM suggested that the abstract patterns around the rim were derived from basketry--a point that intrigued RJ (she will use that association from now on). She made the important point that water birds--non-naturalistic hybrids, appear on all phases of Ulua-Yojoa-Comayagua wares; i.e., early-middle-late.

They could also participate eternally in the cult by placing a votive offering in one of the outer courts of the temple.

      "Through extensive overland and maritime trade routes, Mesopotamian cultural influence spread throughout the Near East, including Egypt, Syria, and the Levant, Arabia, and even India. Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India’s Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive “intercultural style,” with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents.\n",
      "More examples of “intercultural style” vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels or it may have been one of the first stops and a major consumer on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source for chlorite. The recently discovered site of Jiroft in Iran also appears to have been a production center for these vessels, which were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs.\n",
      "Mesopotamia was an important cultural influence on the development of the early Egyptian state, as indicated by ceramic and architectural styles and the use of both cylinder seals and a writing system. Influence from Mesopotamia is evidenced in the Bactrian cultures of Afghanistan, where local versions of Sumerian votive figures were produced, often as composite stone sculptures. In later times, camel caravan routes bringing trade goods from Mesopotamia and the Levant southward into Arabia enriched the kingdoms of ancient Yemen, home of the biblical Queen of Sheba.\n",

      "Arete, the ancient Greek concept of innate excellence, could be demonstrated through physical strength, martial valor, or competitive talent. No hero better illustrates these qualities than Herakles: slayer of monsters and master of seemingly impossible labors, he was also revered as the founder of the Olympic games.  Two of his labors, called athloi (whence our word athletics), are shown here. On the shoulder of the large hydria Herakles performs his first labor, wrestling with the Nemean Lion. He is watched by his patroness, Athena, his servant and nephew, Iolaos, and, by a young woman, perhaps the local nymph, Nemea.

Together, these qualities enabled him to rid the world of monsters that terrorized lesser men.

Several areas of the Near East offered ideal conditions for the introduction of agriculture: a mild climate, the existence of several species of wild grains which flourished on the mountain slopes, and a water supply which could be dammed or drained from streams or marshes.  The agricultural revolution and the domestication of animals developed along with the construction of permanent settlements with substantial brick and stone architecture for private and public buildings.  With the inevitable growth of settled populations came the introduction of specialized craft trades and technological innovations with fulfilled the needs of newly organized, self-sustaining communities.\n",
      "The important developments of the Neolithic period are well represented by the early settlements at Jericho in the Levant, Catal Huyuk in Anatolia, and Tell es Sawwan in northern Mesopotamia.  Each site displays a rich and complex culture with distinctive art, architecture, craft traditions, and burial customs that reflect individual environments, economies, and religions.\n",
      "Jericho (1-12) Ancient Jericho  (Tell es-Sultan) is one of the key sites of the period with and impressive Neolithic settlement.  A massive stone wall, preserved at six meters tall, a large circular tower, and a rock-cut ditch surrounded the entire site.  These major constructions, dating back to ca. 8000 BC, predate other public works found in the Near East by over a thousand years and signal a community that was highly organized for its time.\n",
      "The evidence from Neolithic Jericho reflects the population's change from hunting and gathering to herding domesticated goats and sheep and farming, as evidenced by charred grain found at the site (1).  Tools and weapons used for agriculture and hunting purposes were made primarily from stone and included sickle blades, knives, scrapers, and arrowheads.  Stone grinders, querns, and pestles (2-8) were used to prepare flour and a variety of stone and bone tools, polishing stones (9,10), awls (11), borers and scrapers were utilized for sewing, weaving, leatherworking, basketry and other crafts.  Polished stone vessels (12) served as containers until pottery made its first appearance in the latter part of the period.\n",
      "Catal Huyuk (12-20)  Catal Huyuk, occupied after 6000 BC, was one of the largest, more densely built, and prosperous Neolithic settlements in Anatolia.  Some of the religious art of the period, including painted and plaster molded relief decoration of bulls, rams, felines, and predatory birds were found in rooms that may have been shrines.  A number of human figurines found at the site (17, 18) suggest that a female fertility figure was a prominent deity.  Large numbers of broken and pierced animal figurines of bulls (13-16), boars, and sheep also appeared in pits, perhaps deposited in a form of hunting ritual.\n",
      "The dead were buried beneath the clay plaster-covered platforms in the dwellings.  Some of the grave offerings, made from imported materials, indicate that trade existed with regions bordering the Mediterranean.  Jewelry, beads, and bracelets (19, 20) were left with the burials along with pottery, flint knives, obsidian glass mirrors, and other personal items.\n",
      "Tell es Sawwan (21-28)  Tell es Sawwan was a sophisticated Neolithic settlement near the Tigris River in northern Mesopotamia during the sixth through fifth millennia BC.  The site consisted of a city wall, the earliest defensive system known in Mesopotamia, single dwellings, and large multi-room T-shaped buildings.\n",
      "The dead, as in Jericho, were buried beneath house floors and were left with large quantities of grave goods.  Jewelry, stone-made human figurines and finely crafted alabaster and other stone vessels (21-25) were common offerings for the dead.\n",

      "Strategically situated in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean, the island of Cyprus has always been an important crossroads for political and cultural interchange. During the summer trading season, prevailing winds blow from northwest to southeast, obliged traders from the west visiting Egypt or the Levant to sail northwards and then under the south coast of Asia Minor to return, thus passing Cyprus. The influence of Cyprus on such traders can be seen in an Etruscan bucchero jug exhibited on the opposite side of this gallery whose shape copies a type of jug commonly found in Cyprus. The island, with its high, rugged mountains and fertile plains was rich in copper (Greek kupris) from which it was named. According to myth, it was the birthplace of Aphrodite.\n",

Bronze age Cyprus already had well established links with the Levant, documented for example by the votive female statuette (4) which resembles Syrian types, and by the juglet (5) whose shape imitates a poppy-head, alluding to its use as a container for opium. The bull-rhyton (3) and the jug (6) blend Cypriot with Minoan and Mycenean styles and subject matter. Characteristic of Iron Age Cyprus are the delicately potted Black-on-Red Ware vessels (16) and the later more craft-like Bichrome Ware vessels (14–15). The absence of fine marble on the island meant that stone sculpture was generally made in fine-grained local limestone (13). The so-called temple boy (12), may have represented a temple servant, a temple prostitute or be generally votive, as was the earlier (13).

      "of this gallery whose shape copies a type of jug commonly found in Cyprus. The island, with its high, rugged mountains and fertile plains was rich in copper (Greek kupris) from which it was named. According to myth, it was the birthplace of Aphrodite. The first remains of human creativity from Cyprus date around 7000 BC; two axe-heads (1, 2) date to the fourth millennium BC. Bronze age Cyprus already had well established links with the Levant, documented for example by the votive female statuette (4) which resembles Syrian types, and by the juglet (5) whose shape imitates a poppy-head, alluding to its use as a container for opium. The bull-rhyton (3) and the jug (6) blend Cypriot with Minoan and Mycenean styles and subject matter. Characteristic of Iron Age Cyprus are the delicately potted Black-on-Red Ware vessels (16) and the later more craft-like Bichrome Ware vessels (14–15). The absence of fine marble on the island meant that stone sculpture was generally made in fine-grained local limestone (13). The so-called temple boy (12), may have represented a temple servant, a temple prostitute or be generally votive, as was the earlier (13). Their styles indicate awareness of and admiration for Greek prototypes, but the scale, treatment of the drapery and of the faces, and general character are purely Cypriot. 1, 2.

      "OLD KINGDOM FUNERARY CULTS The pyramids of the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom were built on the edge of the desert opposite the new capital at Memphis. They were surrounded by smaller tombs, called mastabas, belonging to royal relatives and members of the king's court. Earlier versions of these mastaba tombs were encircled by walls of mudbrick laid in an elaborate pattern of niches, which had been derived from the architecture of Mesopotamia. By the early Old Kingdom the style had changed and been translated from brick to stone. By then the surrounding facade of niches was reduced to form a tomb chapel. The niches were the main cult focus of these tombs and became known by archaeologists as the ¿false door¿-a stone portal through which the ancient Egyptians believed the spirit of the deceased could come from beyond and enter the tomb chapel. The spirit was believed to be nourished by the essence of food left by visitors to the tomb, or simply through small, symbolic bowls and dishes placed in front of the false door. \n",
      "This false door came from a tomb at Giza and is inscribed for ¿The overseer of builders, Tebash,¿ written down the right side, over the figure of Tebash. On the roll lintel, the name Tebash is also written, and down the left side, over an image of his wife, is written,¿The lady Merut.¿ Mastaba tombs housed the burials of entire families and could be expanded by later generations. Burial chambers were carved into the earth below the mastaba and were reached by vertical shafts that cut through the body of the structure  itself. The tombs of even the most wealthy were often sparsely furnished with only a headrest, a rectangular coffin, pottery vessels, and offerings of food.\n",

The niches were the main cult focus of these tombs and became known by archaeologists as the ¿false door¿-a stone portal through which the ancient Egyptians believed the spirit of the deceased could come from beyond and enter the tomb chapel. The spirit was believed to be nourished by the essence of food left by visitors to the tomb, or simply through small, symbolic bowls and dishes placed in front of the false door. This false door came from a tomb at Giza and is inscribed for ¿The overseer of builders, Tebash,¿ written down the right side, over the figure of Tebash. On the roll lintel, the name Tebash is also written, and down the left side, over an image of his wife, is written,¿The lady Merut.¿ Mastaba tombs housed the burials of entire families and could be expanded by later generations. Burial chambers were carved into the earth below the mastaba and were reached by vertical shafts that cut through the body of the structure itself. The tombs of even the most wealthy were often sparsely furnished with only a headrest, a rectangular coffin, pottery vessels, and offerings of food. 1. False Door of Tebash and his Wife. Egypt, Giza.

      "Prints are meant to be propagated.  Artists carve wooden blocks or incise metal plates in order to make multiple impressions on paper of their designs, their inventions.  Printmaking is a field rich with possibilities for experimentation.  Artists are challenged to test the limits of the medium, to discover just how much can be expressed by making marks on wood or metal.   Once it leaves the workshop a print can travel far to win fame for the printmaker and to serve as a model for other artists.  Thus, experiments and inventions become a part of the history of printmaking, forming a tradition that succeeding printmakers will react to, revive, and reinvent.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "There are two basic forms of print processes-relief and intaglio.  The woodcut is a relief process in which material is carved away from the lines of the design.  Engravings, etchings, and drypoints are all intaglio processes in which lines are cut into a copper plate from which impressions will be made.  In engraving a tool called a burin is used to gouge grooves directly into the plate.  Etching allows an artist to draw more freely, scratching with a needle through a ground of resin, gum, or wax that has been applied to the plate.  Once the design is complete the plate is bathed in acid which bites into the metal where the surface coating has been scraped away by the needle.  In drypoint the artist works directly on the plate with a very hard needle that throws up a rough burr of metal on either side of the drawn line. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both woodcuts and engravings first appeared in Europe in Germany in the fifteenth century.  Having mastered woodcut and engraving, Albrecht Dürer also tried his hand at etching and drypoint, but did not systematically pursue his efforts.  Lucas van Leyden was the first artist to make etchings on copper plates and combined this process with engraving.  Later in the seventeenth century etching became the preferred technique of artists, and Rembrandt regularly combined it with drypoint to add strong, dark accents to his prints.\n",

      "The Maya crafted tall, straight-sided vessels (1) to hold the high-status beverage kakaw (Spanish cacao, chocolate). Chocolate was domesticated in early Mesoamerica. Maya elites drank it cold and  unsweetened, sometimes with entheogenic (visions-inducing) additives. This vessel shows typical elaboration: hieroglyphic writing on the rim and a complex scene wrapped around the vessel body. The exact tale told in the scene has not been preserved; however, a hero with a shield and spear battles a giant snake from which emanates an armed enemy—a fantastical Vision Serpent seen in other compositions. A god (identifiable by his squared eye) helps the hero by chopping at the snake’s tail with a bloody axe. The black background signals an Underworld context, the dark and watery place below the terrestrial realm, filled with challenges and deadly struggles in Maya mythology.\n",
      "The lid of 2, an incense burner, features a double being. The squared eye identifies the ageing sun god, representing twilight. The jaguar represents the sun at night, believed to travel in the Underworld in animal form. Their back-to-back position makes them both single (the sun) and dual (human and feline). It thus stands for the fundamental concept of the transforming human-animal selves, or in Mayan, the way [why]. Indeed, a few centuries after this piece was created, the Mayan word way was written as a glyph with half a human face and half a jaguar pelt, separated by a wavy line. Look closely at the incense burner: the jaguar’s spots and sun god’s skin meet at just such a wavy line. Thus, the sculpted lid is the three-dimensional version of the hieroglyph for animal-self—making this piece apparently the earliest physical version of this fundamental shamanic idea.\n",

      "\" The finest piece in our Mesoamerican holdings, this Maya cylinder vessel originally contained chocolate, the high-status beverage of the ancient Americas.  (Our word \"\"cocoa\"\" comes from the Spanish \"\"cacao,\"\" a direct transcription of the Maya \"\"kakaw.\"\")  Its extremely fine painting and the addition of hieroglyphs around the rim show it originally belonged a very elite owner.  Experts feel this piece was created around A.D. 650 in what is now northern Guatemala. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the imagery and the writing, as these complex aspects of Maya art are still in the process of decipherment.     What appears to be represented in this painting in the round is a struggle amongst three figures in the Underworld, the dark, watery way-station between life and death.  The standing figure wields a spear to attack a masked man emerging from the gaping maw of a serpent.  A seated god, identified by his square eye, assists the spear-bearer by preparing to chop the serpent's tail with his axe.  Although some traditional Maya stories are preserved in a sixteenth-century book, the Popol Vuh, this particular scene does not appear.  Therefore, its interpretation continues to elude us.     Yet the artistic mastery of Maya vase painting, paralleling that of the ancient Greeks, is anything but elusive.  As if in a dance rather than a fight, graceful gestures are captured with sweeping calligraphic flourish.  This typical lyricism may blind modern audiences to the pervasive theme of domination that permeates Maya art; aesthetics were often used in the service of the political rivalry characteristic of city-states.  Perhaps by commissioning such a mythic battle scene this vessel's owner portrayed himself as victorious over his enemies.  \"\n",

      "\n",
      "During Neolithic times, known to Egyptologists as the Predynastic Period, Egypt was not yet united under a single king. There were, however, many settlements in existence along the Nile valley. Most of these are known today less from their living sites than from their cemeteries that were situated in the Upper Egyptian desert and are thus easily accessible to archaeologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead were buried in a contracted position in shallow pits dug in the sand and were surrounded by grave goods consisting of pots, which probably contained food and drink, and personal items like cosmetic palettes. These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n",
      "\n",
      "The preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n",
      "\t\n",
      "Slate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period. They were used for grinding various ores, such as galena (lead sulphide) or malachite (copper carbonate) in order to produce eye make-up, which was worn by both men and women. \n",
      "\t\n",
      "Finely finished pottery in red and black was characteristic of the Upper Egyptian predynastic and formed part of an African ceramic tradition that continues through the present day. \n",

      "The Predynastic period (4800-3100 BC) saw the transition in Egypt from scattered groups of Neolithic settlers to the dawning of a large, organized state. Even in the earliest phases of the Predynastic Period, the artistic refinement notable in Egyptian art is evident in finely crafted flint and stone tools and ceramic vessels used in daily life or as offerings in tombs. The earliest pottery of the Predynastic Period was fired in simple kilns without control over the firing atmosphere. Areas of the iron-rich clay that were exposed to oxygen fired red, while those that were not, turned black. Eventually, by controlling the firing, pots in all red, all black, or the black-topped style could be produced. White pigment could be used to decorate these vessels as well. Later, in the Naqada II, or Gerzean Period vessels were sometimes decorated with designs in red paint either imitating stone vessels or depicting ritualistic funerary scenes in which a boat brings the deceased for burial.\n",

Even in the earliest phases of the Predynastic Period, the artistic refinement notable in Egyptian art is evident in finely crafted flint and stone tools and ceramic vessels used in daily life or as offerings in tombs. The earliest pottery of the Predynastic Period was fired in simple kilns without control over the firing atmosphere. Areas of the iron-rich clay that were exposed to xygen fired red, while those that were not, turned black. Eventually, by controlling the firing, pots in all red, all black, or the black-topped style could be produced. White pigment could be used to decorate these vessels as well. Later, in the Naqada II, or Gerzean, Period vessels were sometimes decorated with designs in red paint either imitating stone vessels or depicting ritualistic funerary scenes in which a boat brings the deceased for burial. 1-4.

      "\"1994.4.202  Female Figure, Alusi Wood, incrustation including eggshells 29 3/4\"\" x 5 3/4\"\" x 6\"\"  Cross River Region, Nigeria    Research Findings:    Female figures representing ancestral spirits, like this one, are kept in well-tended, embellished shrines by the Igbo peoples of northeastern Nigeria.  These figures, or Alusi, are removed from their shrines, dressed and sometimes painted for annual harvest festivals.    The Igbo also defer to these sculptures for judgement in their administrative affairs.  The oracle will pronounce the verdict and strike the wrongdoer ill.  Certain Alusi are well-known for their efficacy in settling disputes.  People will travel from all over to present their cases before them.  The stance and proportions of these figures, male and female, are typical of the northeastern Igbo region where the posture and traits are stylized.  The facial features of this figure, however, suggests its origin may derive from the Cross River Region, just east of Igbo communities.    For a similiar example, see Schaumann Masken und Figuren Afrikas, attached.   Annotated Bibliography:   Cole, Herbert M. Icons: Ideals and Power in the Art of Africa. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989.     Photo (p. 35, Figure 34) including two figures in similiar stance   and with similiar crests, however, the facial features are not the   same.  Caption describes scene as an annual festival in an Igbo   community where wooden deity figures from all the separate shrines   in the compound are gathered, dressed up and given offerings.     Eyo, Ekpo. Two Thousand Years Nigerian Art. Lagos, Nigeria: Federal Department of Antiquities, 1977.   A standing wooden female (p. 201) attributed to the Igbo of the early twentieth century, is positioned in a similar stance and wears a semi-circular crest like the Arnett figure.  The facial features are quite different.     Fagg, William. African Tribal Images: The Katherine White Reswick Collection. Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1968.   Similar crest appears on an Ibibio female figure (Figure 162).  According to Fagg, this figure is suggestive of the Ogbom headdress figures which the Ibo of Bende adopted and imitated.  The figure style, however, does not resemble the Arnett piece.   Jones, G. I. The Art of Eastern Nigeria. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984.    Two figures (p. 203, Figures 105, 106) carved by the Ugbom   and a double-headed head (p. 201, Figure 103) all from the Umuahia   area illustrate similiar crests yet different facial features than the   Arnett figure.     A mask (p. 209, Figure 112) carved by the Okwanku in the   Abam/Ohaffia area depicts very similiar facial features - large almond-  shaped eyes with delineated eyelids, large columnar nose, large fleshy   lips and squared chin.  The mask is topped by a top protrusion not   unlike the idea of a crest.   Although unfortunately a map is not given, the chapter text   details the activity surrounding the Umuahia area.  The Ibo, Ibibio,   Cross River and Ijo peoples and cultures intermingled, with the Cross   River Ibo groups predominant in the internal slave trade down river.    Various groups, including the Ohaffia, originated from a fusion of Ibo   and Cross River elements.  Some of the Ohaffia towns practiced   masquerades with masks such as Figure 112 carved in local  variations of the Lower Niger style.       Kerchache, Jacques. Scultura Africana: Omaggio a AndrT Malraux. Rome: De Luca Editore, 1986.   A female figure similiar in stance and head crest is illustrated (p. 121).  According to the text, these Igbo figures, known as Alusi, represent ancestral deities and are kept in well-tended, embellished shrines.

The stance and proportions of these figures, male and female, are typical of the northeast Igbo region where the posture and traits are stylized.  Freedom is expressed by the artist, however, in the details.  The crest of the hair is particularly found in the eastern region.   Schaumann, Fritz. Masken und Figuren Afrikas.    A female figure resembling the Arnett work is pictured (p. 25).  The accompanying text refers to this and other such Igbo figures from the northeastern region as Alusi, their ancestral deities, and are kept in special shrines.  Every year the Alusi are paraded around the village during the annual harvest festival.   Wittmer, Marcilene K. And William Arnett. Three Rivers of Nigeria.

Arnett figure (p. 74-75, Figure 177) illustrated with short   supporting text comparing the \"\"naturalistic style of this old piece\"\" to   others from the Cross River Region (Figures 132 and 176).  The Efik,   living on the east side of the inlet and along the Cross River,   assimilated carving styles from other groups along the trading route   and dispersed them over a large area along the river.  According to   the caption, the face has some characteristics in common with two   famous figures said to be from the Ijo port of Brass.  These figures   are not illustrated.   \"\n",

      "Maya Polychrome Ceramics\n",
      "During their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts. Class consciousness can also be discerned in vessels that imitate high status examples (3).\n",
      "The subjects may be expressively human, such as a gentle and genteel Maya mother with a child on her back (6, the baby’s head has broken off). They may relate to rulers, adding a profile face found on royal headdresses and scepters (5) to a container for drinking the high-status chocolate beverage kakaw. Further up the scale, some vessels concern deities: 2 represents the snakefooted god K’awil, patron of divination and rulership. Highly esoteric images include disembodied eyeballs interspersed with jaguar spots (4), perhaps a reference to the addition of entheogens to the kakaw and the dizzying visions of becoming a jaguar that result.\n",
      "Some pieces speak to issues we may not associate with preindustrial societies, including “art for art’s sake.” While most Maya ceramics depict recognizable imagery, 1’s subject is limited to the brushstroke itself, seemingly an instance of art about art. The elevated social status of the artist, usually just below royalty, apparently meant that at times aesthetics could be self-referential.\n",
      "The social status hierarchy is also apparent in 3: while many chocolate vessels have hieroglyphs painted around the rim identifying the scene and/or the pot’s owner, here the generalized shapes in this position are actually only pretend writing. These “pseudo-glyphs” indicate that the owner had an artist, who presumably could not read glyphs either, come up with gibberish to impress others. A highly elaborated culture generates fine social distinctions, and rule breaking as well as following them.\n",

      "OLD KINGDOM FUNERARY CULTS The pyramids of the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom were built on the edge of the desert opposite the new capital at Memphis. They were surrounded by smaller tombs, called mastabas, belonging to royal relatives and members of the king's court. Earlier versions of these mastaba tombs were encircled by walls of mudbrick laid in an elaborate pattern of niches, which had been derived from the architecture of Mesopotamia. By the early Old Kingdom the style had changed and been translated from brick to stone. By then the surrounding facade of niches was reduced to form a tomb chapel. The niches were the main cult focus of these tombs and became known by archaeologists as the ¿false door¿-a stone portal through which the ancient Egyptians believed the spirit of the deceased could come from beyond and enter the tomb chapel. The spirit was believed to be nourished by the essence of food left by visitors to the tomb, or simply through small, symbolic bowls and dishes placed in front of the false door. \n",
      "This false door came from a tomb at Giza and is inscribed for ¿The overseer of builders, Tebash,¿ written down the right side, over the figure of Tebash. On the roll lintel, the name Tebash is also written, and down the left side, over an image of his wife, is written,¿The lady Merut.¿ Mastaba tombs housed the burials of entire families and could be expanded by later generations. Burial chambers were carved into the earth below the mastaba and were reached by vertical shafts that cut through the body of the structure  itself. The tombs of even the most wealthy were often sparsely furnished with only a headrest, a rectangular coffin, pottery vessels, and offerings of food.\n",

English and Museum purchase OLD KINGDOM FUNERARY CULTS The pyramids of the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom were built on the edge of the desert opposite the new capital at Memphis. They were surrounded by smaller tombs, called mastabas, belonging to royal relatives and members of the king's court. Earlier versions of these mastaba tombs were encircled by walls of mudbrick laid in an elaborate pattern of niches, which had been derived from the architecture of Mesopotamia. By the early Old Kingdom the style had changed and been translated from brick to stone. By then the surrounding facade of niches was reduced to form a tomb chapel. The niches were the main cult focus of these tombs and became known by archaeologists as the ¿false door¿-a stone portal through which the ancient Egyptians believed the spirit of the deceased could come from beyond and enter the tomb chapel. The spirit was believed to be nourished by the essence of food left by visitors to the tomb, or simply through small, symbolic bowls and dishes placed in front of the false door. This false door came from a tomb at Giza and is inscribed for ¿The overseer of builders, Tebash,¿ written down the right side, over the figure of Tebash. On the roll lintel, the name Tebash is also written, and down the left side, over an image of his wife, is written,¿The lady Merut.¿ Mastaba tombs housed the burials of entire families and could be expanded by later generations. Burial chambers were carved into the earth below the mastaba and were reached by vertical shafts that cut through the body of the structure itself. The tombs of even the most wealthy were often sparsely furnished with only a headrest, a rectangular coffin, pottery vessels, and offerings of food. 1. False Door of Tebash and his Wife. Egypt, Giza.

      " The origins of Greek art can  be traced  far back  into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (11), Minoan (15), and Mycenaean (12-14, 16) civilizations flourished.  The Cycladic culture, which reached its zenith during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000-2000 B.C.), centered on a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea.  Small stone sculptures were among the most characteristic forms of Cycladic art, with the so-called violin figurines (11), highly abstracted depictions of the female form, representing the earliest type.  We know little about the original function of these objects, most of which were found in graves or settlements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minoan Crete dominated the Aegean Sea from ca. 2000-1450 B.C. Bronze or lead votive statuettes (15) rank among the most typical Minoan objects; a male worshiper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration.  In the Late Bronze Age, the mainland Mycenaeans established a vast trading empire, supplanting the Minoans in the Aegean. Distinctive Mycenaean stirrup jars (12, 14), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean.\n",
      "\n",

Witten, II. 118G Permanent collection gallery: EARLY GREECE The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (11), Minoan (15), and Mycenaean (12-14, 16) civilizations flourished. The Cycladic culture, which reached its zenith during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000-2000 B.C.), centered on a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea. Small stone sculptures were among the most characteristic forms of Cycladic art, with the so-called violin figurines (11), highly abstracted depictions of the female form, representing the earliest type. We know little about the original function of these objects, most of which were found in graves or settlements. Minoan Crete dominated the Aegean Sea from ca. 2000-1450 B.C. Bronze or lead votive statuettes (15) rank among the most typical Minoan objects; a male worshiper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration. In the Late Bronze Age, the mainland Mycenaeans established a vast trading empire, supplanting the Minoans in the Aegean. Distinctive Mycenaean stirrup jars (12, 14), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean. The collapse of the Greek Bronze Age civilizations was followed by a \"Dark Age\" lasting about two centuries. Greek society began to reassert itself in the ninth and eighth centuries B.C. This society created a new artistic style characterized by abstract geometric forms (7-10), which gives this early period of Greek history-the Geometric period-its name. The presence of figural decoration in ceramics and small sculptures signals a renewed interest in the natural world that remained central throughout Greek history. Bronze horses (10) exemplify the Geometric style, with the body of the horse reduced to its essential geometric forms and yet conveying the essential qualities of the animal: strength and grace.

      "Artists have at their disposal many ways to work clay and decorate its surface, most of which were explored in Northern Andean ceramics. First, objects can be constructed by flattening out slabs of clay (6, 7) or by spiraling many coils of clay into simple (1-5) or more complex containers (8). Before firing, solid portions may be added by the appliqué technique (seen in the head and limbs of 8). While pushing these solid forms onto the bowl, the artist must avoid distorting the bowl itself with the pressure and introducing air bubbles that will ultimately explode the entire composition during firing. The surface may be incised, drawn into with a sharp, fine tool to make indented lines, as in the features of the fish (6, 7) or the body decorations of a human (8). The smooth edges of the incisions in 6 and 7 contrast with the scratchy lines of 8; the former were incised when the clay was leather hard, dried but not fired, whereas the latter were incised after firing, when the clay resisted the potter's tools. \n",

      "The ceramics of the ancient Americas were all painted with slip. Slip is a very fine suspension of natural mineral pigments in water, painted on before the pot was fired at about 500-700° c. The color range of slips in the ancient Americas includes red, orange, brown, white, buff, black, and brown.  Finely prepared slips require a great deal of work in order to locate and gather the finest-grained clays, which are then soaked in water and the residue drained off repeatedly. Coarser slips may be burnished (rubbed hard with a smooth stone to compress the outermost layer of clay) before firing to achieve a high shine. When fired, slip fuses to the bowl's surface (it cannot flake off like paint applied after firing).  Slip may be directly applied, as in 3, 4, and 5. However, a second approach to pigmenting the ceramic surface can be seen in 2 and 1: negative painting. In this technique, characteristic of the Northern Andes, the first layer of slip was  painted with resin to keep it from being covered by subsequent layers. In 1, a buff coat was covered in resin (the birds and lines), and then the rest was painted in brown. During the firing the resin burned off and the final light-on-dark design became apparent. This process is \"\"negative\"\" in the sense that the artist did not paint the birds in light slip over a dark ground, but the reverse. It involves the artist being able to visualize the final effect, although unable to see it while creating it. Even more complex is 2, in which both red and buff were applied and resined in patterns before the brown was added.   \n",

      "CRAFT TRADITIONS AT JERICHO Stone working, woodworking,  and textile and pottery production are four examples of craft traditions which flourished at Jericho.  Each population and period can be identified by distinctive characteristics reflected by the objects used in everyday life. Artifacts reveal methods of manufacture and the state of technology, the preferences for certain materials, either locally obtained or imported, and the indigenous or foreign influences on artistic traditions and styles. \n",
      "STONEWORKING (1-3)   The production of stone tools, weapons, and vessels was the premier craft industry from the Neolithic period into the Early Bronze Age.   Although no artifacts here illustrate the industry in its early manifestations, alabaster vessels are an example of Middle Bronze Age stoneworking (1-3). These vessels were first produced in Egypt as small containers for ointments, precious perfumes, and aromatic oils and were imported to the Levant as well as locally produced.  At Jericho, craftsmen used a local alabaster, known as gypsum or calcium sulphate, which was probably obtained from Beisan, 70 kilometers from the site.\n",
      "The softness of alabaster made it easy to work.  A block of stone was cut into a cylindrical shape and hollowed out with a metal chisel or drill.  In some cases, the vessels were made in several pieces, with the rim and the neck worked separately and then inserted into the body.  Finally, the surface was polished with a finely ground sandstone such as sandquartz.\n",
      "WOODWORKING (4-6)  At Jericho, Middle Bronze Age tombs are the sole source for our knowledge of wooden artifacts, including boxes (4), vessels (6), and furniture (5).  The partial survival of furniture was especially remarkable, since they present a picture of what the furnished houses of Jericho might have looked like.  Tables were long and narrow, consisting of a single plank attached by tenon and mortise joints to three legs, a feature which made the tables more stable on uneven earth-covered floors. Stools were of two sizes, seating either one or two persons.  The legs and seat-rails were made from wood, while the seats were made of rushes, suggested by the holes bored in the seat-rails.  Decoration was limited to the legs of furniture, which were often carved in a curved geometric form, loosely derived from Egyptian style furniture.  Other wooden items used in households included vessels (6) and wooden boxes (4), often decorated with incised bone inlay.\n",
      "Craftsmen used local timbers such as tamarisk and willow to fashion small wooden items, while stronger, higher quality timber, such as imported cedar, was utilized for larger furniture.  Though very few tools have survived, it is presumed that copper and, more rarely, bronze axes, adzes, and saws would\n",
      "have been employed for hewing, trimming timber, and cutting planks, while chisels, bow drills, and awls would have been used to carve and cut mortises, tenons, and bore holes.\n",
      "SPINNING AND WEAVING (7-12) Evidence for the textile industry in ancient Jericho is recorded by badly preserved textile fragments and various tools and accessories which have survived.  It is presumed that, at various times, the people of Jericho used plant fibers from palm trees, flax, and possibly animal hair fibers to weave and sew clothing.  Draped robes and kilts made of a plain weave were attached by toggle pins (12) and worn along with rarer tunics that were cut and sewn into shape.\n",
      "Analogies with the textile industry in Egypt suggest that the process of making textiles at Jericho probably consisted of three steps.  Fibers were prepared by being soaked, beaten, and combed out or hackled.  The fibers were then ready for spinning where they were then drawn on a spindle and twisted to produce yarn.  As early as the Pottery Neolithic Period at Jericho (ca. 5500-4000 B.C.), wooden spindles weighted with a whorl made of wood or stone (8-10) were commonly used.  After spinning, the yarn was warped on the loom.  Because very few loom weights (7) have been found in the Bronze Age levels (1800-1550 B.C.), it is possible that a horizontal loom was used.  \n",
      "Little is known about the tools involved in the weaving process at Jericho except that they were used in other industries.  Awls (11), for example, were likely to have been used to press  down the weft in the course of the weaving when no comb was available, or to pick up the threads of the weft to make designs.\n",
      "POTTERY PRODUCTION (13-19)  Pottery, more so than any other craft, shows the growing sophistication in technique displayed by Jericho's changing potters.  Pottery first appeared at Jericho in the Neolithic Period along with the arrival of newcomers during the sixth millennium B.C.  These early potters produced simple handmade vessels, such as bowls, juglets, and lamps (13, 14).  During the Early Bronze Age, potters introduced the innovation of a slow wheel, which was used to make the necks and rims of vessels that attached onto handmade bodies (15). Vessels made entirely on a faster potter's wheel (16, 17) were produced during the later Middle Bronze Age.\n",
      "In addition to the potter's wheel, various containers and tools were used by the potter.  Jars served as containers for water, slip, wash, and paint.  Mortars (20) and pestles (19) were probably used to grind temper for clay or colored minerals and pigments for decoration.  Once formed, the pot may have been burnished by rubbing shells or smooth stones (18) across the surface. In Jericho, no workshops or kilns were found, but evidence from elsewhere in the Levant suggests that pottery was fired in open fire pits or in permanent kilns located on the outskirts of the city.\n",

      "foreign influences on artistic traditions and styles. STONEWORKING (1-3) The production of stone tools, weapons, and vessels was the premier craft industry from the Neolithic period into the Early Bronze Age. Although no artifacts here illustrate the industry in its early manifestations, alabaster vessels are an example of Middle Bronze Age stoneworking (1-3). These vessels were first produced in Egypt as small containers for ointments, precious perfumes, and aromatic oils and were imported to the Levant as well as locally produced. At Jericho, craftsmen used a local alabaster, known as gypsum or calcium sulphate, which was probably obtained from Beisan, 70 kilometers from the site. The softness of alabaster made it easy to work. A block of stone was cut into a cylindrical shape and hollowed out with a metal chisel or drill. In some cases, the vessels were made in several pieces, with the rim and the neck worked separately and then inserted into the body. Finally, the surface was polished with a finely ground sandstone such as sandquartz. WOODWORKING (4-6) At Jericho, Middle Bronze Age tombs are the sole source for our knowledge of wooden artifacts, including boxes (4), vessels (6), and furniture (5). The partial survival of furniture was especially remarkable, since they present a picture of what the furnished houses of Jericho might have looked like. Tables were long and narrow, consisting of a single plank attached by tenon and mortise joints to three legs, a feature which made the tables more stable on uneven earth-covered floors. Stools were of two sizes, seating either one or two persons. The legs and seat-rails were made from wood, while the seats were made of rushes, suggested by the holes bored in the seat-rails. Decoration was limited to the legs of furniture, which were often carved in a curved geometric form, loosely derived from Egyptian style furniture. Other wooden items used in households included vessels (6) and wooden boxes (4), often decorated with incised bone inlay. Craftsmen used local timbers such as tamarisk and willow to fashion small wooden items, while stronger, higher quality timber, such as imported cedar, was utilized for larger furniture. Though very few tools have survived, it is presumed that copper and, more rarely, bronze axes, adzes, and saws would have been employed for hewing, trimming timber, and cutting planks, while chisels, bow drills, and awls would have been used to carve and cut mortises, tenons, and bore holes. SPINNING AND WEAVING (7-12) Evidence for the textile industry in ancient Jericho is recorded by badly preserved textile fragments and various tools and accessories which have survived. It is presumed that, at various times, the people of Jericho used plant fibers from palm trees, flax, and possibly animal hair fibers to weave and sew clothing. Draped robes and kilts made of a plain weave were attached by toggle pins (12) and worn along with rarer tunics that were cut and sewn into shape. Analogies with the textile industry in Egypt suggest that the process of making textiles at Jericho probably consisted of three steps. Fibers were prepared by\n",

      "THE ECONOMY IN MESOPOTAMIA\n",
      "One of Mesopotamia's most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East was cuneiform (¿wedge-shaped¿) writing. In use for more than 3000 years (ca. 3100 bc-ad 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative, and dedicatory texts. Economic texts were extremely numerous, describing goods being traded, wages paid, and rations distributed. These were measured in the ancient Mesopotamian units of ga, gu, or sa. In order for the documents not to be tampered with, important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope on which the text was recorded again and a seal applied. \n",
      "The Mesopotamians used sets of standard weights in conducting business. The weights themselves were usually made of a very hard stone like hematite. A simple barrel shape was the most common form, but weights in the form of ducks and other animals were also common. High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in Mesopotamia, and therefore, the majority of the stones used to manufacture vessels, cylinder seals, and weights had to be imported. Stone vessels were valued and highly prized and were often used as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n",

      "In ancient Egypt, mummification was also used to preserve the bodies of animals, including household pets, although most animal mummies were intended for ritual purposes.\n",
      "Animals sacred to a deity were bred, mummified, and buried in vast cemeteries. Individuals could present such an animal as a votive offering, alone or encased in a pot or a tiny coffin of wood or bronze surmounted by a figure of the animal. In some instances, the coffin itself was in the shape of the animal.\n",

      "Although there is evidence of cults dedicated to animals as early as the Predynastic Period, their popularity did not peak until the Late Ptolemaic Periods.  Animals sacred to certain deities were bred, sacrificed, mummified, and buried in huge necropoleis within the temple precincts.  The cult of the Apis bull was one of the oldest animal cults and ultimately, the most renowned.  Unlike other cults that might sacrifice thousands of animals, that of the Apis bull centered around a single, chosen animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fertility god called Apis was venerated as early as the First Dynasty, although the deity ultimately merged with Ptah, a creator-god.  The Apis bull was considered the physical manifestation of Ptah, containing the ba, or essence, of the deity.  Worshipped in the cult center of Ptah at Memphis, the Apis was treated to a coronation ceremony and a luxurious lifestyle in a sacred precinct.  Each bull was selected after an exhaustive search throughout Egypt.  According to Herodotus, the fifth-century BC Greek historian, the Apis bull \"is the calf of a cow which is never afterwards able to have another...a flash of light descends upon the cow from heaven, and this causes her to receive Apis.  The Apis-calf has distinctive marks: it is black, with a white diamond on its forehead, the image of an eagle on its back, the hairs on its tail double, and a scarab under its tongue\" (Book 3, ch. 29).\n",
      "\n",
      "The death of the Apis bull was accompanied by even greater ceremony than its installation.  Beginning in the reign of Amenhotep III, the bull was mummified just as a human would have been and entombed in an enormous sarcophagus in a necropolis known as the Serapeum.  Located at Saqqara, the Serapeum was actively used for Apis burials from the New Kingdom until the Ptolemaic Period.  Just as with a human burial, the Apis was provided with extensive funerary equipment, including Canopic jars and shabtis, both of which were typically bull-headed.  The Apis bull and the Serapeum were the focus of intense public piety beginning in the Late Period.  Within the subterranean chambers and corridors of the Serapeum, hundreds of visitors dedicated stelae and votive images of the bull as signs of their devotion.  Small, bronze figures were particularly popular, often depicting the donor kneeling before the Apis, or simply the bull with an inscription.  Stelae of all sizes and levels of quality were inserted in the walls throughout the Serapeum, typically portraying the dedicant paying homage to Apis.  In this instance, several donors appear before the crowned bull, including both men and women, probably members of the same family.\n",

      "Upon its death, the Apis bull as identified with Osiris in a syncretized form known as Osiris-Apis or Osorapis.  Ptolemy I Soter (ca. 305-285 BC) introduced a cult specifically devoted to this deity in a Hellenized form as Serapis.  The cult of Serapis, in conjunction with that of Isis, the wife of Osiris manifest in the mother of the Apis bull, was whole-heartedly embraced by the Graeco-Roman world, spreading to its farthest boundaries.  The Apis bull represented on of the most enduring aspects of Egyptian religion and culture, venerated until the destruction of the Serapeum in the fourth century AD, when the Emperor Honorius banned the use of pagan sanctuaries.\n",

      "The typical Panamanian grave, such as those at the cemetery of Sitio Conte, contained any number of smashed ceramics (5). The \"ritual killing\" of objects characterized almost all ancient American cultures. Purposeful defacing, breaking, or violent altering of artwork may have either been a politically motivated power statement or represented the desire to take prestige items out of economic circulation. Mutilation may also indicate the spiritual belief that all things have a life force that must be modified when the object goes into the Underworld. If plates were considered alive, they apparently had to be killed to properly accompany the deceased in the burial. In order to honor the ancient practices, a poorly restored pedestal plate was returned to the fragmentary state it had taken on in the grave (5). Before being smashed, it looked more like objects 1 and 6.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Inversion (1) was another unusual way of treating pedestal plates in the Sitio Conte burials. Some of the many offerings were placed upright, but others were turned upside down to feature the underside. This inverted pedestal plate shows the care with which the underside was often painted. Ancient American artists paid attention to all sides of works of art out of respect for an object's essential completeness, an important part of its being considered alive. This inverted burial position also served to give the Underworld, the mirror of the terrestrial world, its own perspective on the imagery. \n",

      "Other typical Panamanian grave goods included hand axes (2, 3), spear points (4), and plain ceramics (6). Panamanian hand axes were made from hard, practical stones and were usually broken from heavy use, showing that their actual function as land-clearing tools was paramount in their meaning when placed in the grave. Evidently they symbolized the agricultural prowess of the deceased and the belief that provisioning was to be continued in the afterlife. By contrast, the spear points were chipped from chert and jasper and may have been ceremonial, given their tiny size and striking colors of orange, green, and purple. The colors favored for the points are those found in ceramic slips, especially the orange and the purple. (Purple, seen in 1, is one of the most unusual slip colors known and, in the Americas, was developed only here and in the Andean Nasca culture.)

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets.

It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.

This vessel type evolved from small piriform, or pear-shaped juglets that originated in the Levant and were copied in Egypt in a black polished version incised with patterns of white-filled dots or lines.

      "The Levant: Bronze-Iron Ages (ca. 3300-586 BC) The material culture of the Levant illustrates the region's important role as a bridge between Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and other areas of the Near East.  Direct and indirect contacts with these cultures influences much of the history and cultural development of the Levant.  The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan.\n",
      "1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired.  The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving.  Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2).  This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan.\n",
      "304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter's wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes.  Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. \n",
      "5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean.  ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters.  Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware  Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline.\n",
      "8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age.  Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles.  These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles.\n",
      "10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age.  Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris.  Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin.  Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant.\n",
      "18.  This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age.  The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes.  Used as cult objects, these figurines were a schematic representation of a female deity and throne and reflect a Mycenaean religious heritage that was preserved by the Philistines.\n",
      "14-15.  These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan.  At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture.  Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire.  Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period.  A large proportion of the pottery (17) was simply painted in a fashion local to the region and northern Arabia.\n",
      "21. During the 7th century BC a system of marked and plain dome-shaped weights came into use in the Levant.  The different sized weights were based on the shekel, averaging 11.4 grams, and were used for weighing payment in the form of silver ingots for trade transactions.\n",

      "The Near East During the Neolithic Period (ca 8500-4300 BC)  During the 4000 years of the Neolithic period, people in the Near East introduced changes that had far-reaching consequences for the development of civilization.  This period saw certain populations change their method of subsistence from hunting and gathering to food production.  Several areas of the Near East offered ideal conditions for the introduction of agriculture: a mild climate, the existence of several species of wild grains which flourished on the mountain slopes, and a water supply which could be dammed or drained from streams or marshes.  The agricultural revolution and the domestication of animals developed along with the construction of permanent settlements with substantial brick and stone architecture for private and public buildings.  With the inevitable growth of settled populations came the introduction of specialized craft trades and technological innovations with fulfilled the needs of newly organized, self-sustaining communities.\n",
      "The important developments of the Neolithic period are well represented by the early settlements at Jericho in the Levant, Catal Huyuk in Anatolia, and Tell es Sawwan in northern Mesopotamia.  Each site displays a rich and complex culture with distinctive art, architecture, craft traditions, and burial customs that reflect individual environments, economies, and religions.\n",
      "Jericho (1-12) Ancient Jericho  (Tell es-Sultan) is one of the key sites of the period with and impressive Neolithic settlement.  A massive stone wall, preserved at six meters tall, a large circular tower, and a rock-cut ditch surrounded the entire site.  These major constructions, dating back to ca. 8000 BC, predate other public works found in the Near East by over a thousand years and signal a community that was highly organized for its time.\n",
      "The evidence from Neolithic Jericho reflects the population's change from hunting and gathering to herding domesticated goats and sheep and farming, as evidenced by charred grain found at the site (1).  Tools and weapons used for agriculture and hunting purposes were made primarily from stone and included sickle blades, knives, scrapers, and arrowheads.  Stone grinders, querns, and pestles (2-8) were used to prepare flour and a variety of stone and bone tools, polishing stones (9,10), awls (11), borers and scrapers were utilized for sewing, weaving, leatherworking, basketry and other crafts.  Polished stone vessels (12) served as containers until pottery made its first appearance in the latter part of the period.\n",
      "Catal Huyuk (12-20)  Catal Huyuk, occupied after 6000 BC, was one of the largest, more densely built, and prosperous Neolithic settlements in Anatolia.  Some of the religious art of the period, including painted and plaster molded relief decoration of bulls, rams, felines, and predatory birds were found in rooms that may have been shrines.  A number of human figurines found at the site (17, 18) suggest that a female fertility figure was a prominent deity.  Large numbers of broken and pierced animal figurines of bulls (13-16), boars, and sheep also appeared in pits, perhaps deposited in a form of hunting ritual.\n",
      "The dead were buried beneath the clay plaster-covered platforms in the dwellings.  Some of the grave offerings, made from imported materials, indicate that trade existed with regions bordering the Mediterranean.  Jewelry, beads, and bracelets (19, 20) were left with the burials along with pottery, flint knives, obsidian glass mirrors, and other personal items.\n",
      "Tell es Sawwan (21-28)  Tell es Sawwan was a sophisticated Neolithic settlement near the Tigris River in northern Mesopotamia during the sixth through fifth millennia BC.  The site consisted of a city wall, the earliest defensive system known in Mesopotamia, single dwellings, and large multi-room T-shaped buildings.\n",
      "The dead, as in Jericho, were buried beneath house floors and were left with large quantities of grave goods.  Jewelry, stone-made human figurines and finely crafted alabaster and other stone vessels (21-25) were common offerings for the dead.\n",

      "During Neolithic times, known to Egyptologists as the Predynastic Period, Egypt was not yet united under a single king.

These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n",
      "\n",
      "The preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n",

      "Slate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period.

      "THE PREDYNASTIC PERIOD\n",
      "The Predynastic period (4800-3100 BC) saw the transition in Egypt from scattered groups of Neolithic settlers to the dawning of a large, organized state. Even in the earliest phases of the Pre-dynastic Period, the artistic refinement notable in Egyptian art is evident in finely crafted flint and stone tools and ceramic vessels used in daily life or as offerings in tombs. The earliest pottery of the Predynastic Period was fired in simple kilns without control over the firing atmosphere. Areas of the iron-rich clay that were exposed to oxygen fired red, while those that were not, turned black. Eventually, by controlling the firing, pots in all red, all black, or the black-topped style could be produced. White pigment could be used to decorate these vessels as well. Later, in the Naqada II, or Gerzean Period vessels were sometimes decorated with designs in red paint either imitating stone vessels or depicting ritualistic funerary scenes in which a boat brings the deceased for burial.\n",

      "The Persian conquest of the sixth century B.C. had little impact on the culture of the Levant.  With Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in 333 B.C, new elements and forms of art were injected into local life. Hellenistic ideas and styles became the fashion until the Roman domination after 64 B.C., when a trend of standardization pervaded the Empire. The Romans provided the Levant an unprecedented level of security and prosperity. About A.D. 330, Christianity became the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the region, churches were built while temples were destroyed, especially in Jerusalem, and religious conflicts destabilized the Levant.  The period ended with the Muslim conquest of A.D. 640.\n",

      "The Common Features of Ancient Mesoamerican Cultures\n",
      "Archaeologists define Mesoamerica (“Middle America”) as the area roughly between present-day Mexico City and Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Although numerous cultures rose and fell there since Neolithic times, certain common features united them: solar and ritual calendars (11, 12), the world’s first ballgame (8), foodstuffs such as maize (14) and turkey (13), ritualized music (5–7), and working of rare materials obsidian (1–3), Spondylus (spiny oyster) shell (4), and greenstone (9, 10).\n",
      "The Mesoamerican calendars are very complex (see “Counting Time in Ancient Mesoamerica” at left). Two were shared throughout: the 365-day solar and the 260-day ritual cycle. Here two Maya vessels concern calendrics: 11 displays painted k’in signs, each denoting a day or sun passage, while 12 illustrates a date in the ritual calendar “7 Ahau.” The black background suggests the k’in signs represent time passing in the Underworld, a dark place of creativity and challenge. The “7 Ahau” also references the Other Side by being written backwards—Ahau (the face) uncharacteristically placed to the left of the bar for 5 and dots for 2. Key Maya monuments show reversed writing in association with shamanic visions and “7” represents reflection and contemplation, while ahau denotes the top, leader, and completion.\n",
      "The Underworld was also celebrated in the Mesoamerican ballgame, a ritual contest made possible by the early discovery of rubber along the Gulf Coast. The Maya ballcourt markers often show animals—8 is a monkey, a character from the creation story that takes place mostly in the Underworld. In this tale, two sets of heroic twins battle the death gods and create humans from maize, ensuring life. The Young Maize God (14) appears as a handsome young man whose crosshatched patterns represent kernels and long feathers drooping from his head symbolize corn silk. Scientific tests of residue inside this vessel confirmed it originally held maize.\n",
      "Music and art were highly developed. Effigy rattles (10, 11) depict elaborately dressed Maya women and a figural flute from Veracruz contains sliding interior balls to create glissando effects (7). Elites wore precious jadeite earrings (9) and greenstone beads (10) and ear ornaments made from the thin, red-orange lining of the spiny oyster (Spondylus americanus) (4). Jadeite occurred in only one source and Spondylus oysters clung to rocks deep in the Caribbean—both very hard to  obtain. Likewise, obsidian (volcanic glass) had few sources and great skill was needed to slice razor-sharp blades (3) from cores (2) and to chip spearheads (1).\n",

      "Maya Cylinder Vessels (3, 5-7, 9, 10) were actually used to contain chocolate drinks (in Mayan languages kakaw [kah-kow], from which our word \"cocoa\" originates). Bowls (1, 4, 8, 11, 12) held the staple maize cereals and gruels; in fact, scientific tests of residue left in 11 revealed maize. By contrast, some vessels were intentionally rendered unusable: some flat plates (2) were \"killed\" by drilling a hole in their center. Such  vessels placed upside down over the face of the deceased were believed to allow the soul to exit the body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most Maya ceramics were painted, but a few were incised (7, 11, 12). A band of carved glyphs (7), painted glyphs (5, 10), or, interestingly, painted imitations of glyphs (6) is often found around the rim. Pretend writing can be seen as a form of social climbing: in a society with a low literacy rate the appearance of readable glyphs added some prestige to a \"middle-class\" pot. The currently untranslatable glyphs in 10 read \"hok\" and \"bok.\" Of the over thirty Maya languages, not all have been deciphered yet.\n",

      "Painted designs range from simple brushstrokes (1) to patterns of shells (8), from monstrous supernatural heads (5) to abstract symbols that combine animal characteristics (6), from Underworld scenes (10) to signs for ?day? (3), and from the calendrical date \"7 Ahau\" (4) to extruded eyeballs (9). The most complex scene (10) depicts a struggle between a snake, a seated god about to stab the snake with his bloody axe, and a spear-bearer (not visible here, as extensive modern overpainting was removed from his torso). This piece epitomizes the complexity, elegance, and subtlety of the Maya artistic vision.\n",

Permanent collection gallery: Late Classic Maya Ceramics Maya Cylinder Vessels (3, 5-7, 9, 10) were actually used to contain chocolate drinks (in Mayan languages kakaw [kah-kow], from which our word \"cocoa\" originates). Bowls (1, 4, 8, 11, 12) held the staple maize cereals and gruels; in fact, scientific tests of residue left in 11 revealed maize. By contrast, some vessels were intentionally rendered unusable: some flat plates (2) were \"killed\" by drilling a hole in their center. Such vessels placed upside down over the face of the deceased were believed to allow the soul to exit the body. Most Maya ceramics were painted, but a few were incised (7, 11, 12). A band of carved glyphs (7), painted glyphs (5, 10), or, interestingly, painted imitations of glyphs (6) is often found around the rim. Pretend writing can be seen as a form of social climbing: in a society with a low literacy rate the appearance of readable glyphs added some prestige to a \"middle-class\" pot. The currently untranslatable glyphs in 10 read \"hok\" and \"bok.\" Of the over thirty Maya languages, not all have been deciphered yet. Painted\n",

      "The Persian conquest of the sixth century B.C. had little impact on the culture of the Levant.  With Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in 333 B.C, new elements and forms of art were injected into local life. Hellenistic ideas and styles became the fashion until the Roman domination after 64 B.C., when a trend of standardization pervaded the Empire. The Romans provided the Levant an unprecedented level of security and prosperity. About A.D. 330, Christianity became the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the region, churches were built while temples were destroyed, especially in Jerusalem, and religious conflicts destabilized the Levant.  The period ended with the Muslim conquest of A.D. 640.\n",

      "Through large scale, bold color, or aggressive imagery ¿predatory animal references, horns, and strange tubular eyes¿each of these masks (1¿5) is a visually intimidating presence that harnesses the power of spirits from the wilderness as instruments of proprietary control in the realm of the town or village. Their visual affect was only heightened during performance. For example, Itrokwu (1), a massive horizontal mask in the shape of an elephant, is called the ¿king of mask spirits¿ by its owners, the ruling Ekpari clan of central Idomaland, Nigeria. Irokwu is a royal mask, indicated by its great size and imagery¿the elephant as metaphor for power. This metaphor is played out in the performance of the masquerade, which generates a high degree of tension. Its dance is ¿hot,¿ bursting onto the scene aggressively, knocking over food-drying platforms, scattering cooking pots and audience members, who remain at a respectful distance. The  mask¿s royal status is also indicated by its accoutrements: it has its own stool carried by an attendant so that it can ¿rest,¿ and it is worn with a costume of high status, indigo-dyed burial cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So too, the impressive scale renders the Buffalo mask (2) an effective agent of the Kwifoyn society, an organization of elders and councilors who serve to support and balance the power of kings ruling the various kingdoms of the Grassfields region in neighboring Cameroon. Buffalo masks appear in large groups, along with other animal and human character masks owned by men¿s title societies. In contrast to the easily decipherable iconography of (2), the Wé mask (5) presents a bewildering accumulation of animal references: a fringe of aluminum-silver pseudo-leopard teeth, wild boar tusks, and pointed ears. With its bold color and bullet casings, this prototypical nature spiritmask is wild and menacing, making it a powerful judge during legal disputes and a great motivator of men preparing for battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dan of Liberia once created many different masks to embody spirits of the forest. The tubular eyes seen on (3) suggest that it may be either a Zakpäi gä or ¿fire extinguisher¿ mask that helped to maintain social order in villages during the dry season, or a Glewa mask that kept order within the initiation camps of young boys undergoing the transition to adulthood. A policing function was also performed by (4), a Wan-zega mask from Burkina Faso. Wan-zega appear in groups at the onset of funerals, brandishing long flexible whips made from branches which they use to strike out at spectators. Their presence marks the uncertain period of transition when the deceased begins the journey into the spirit world. Later, the mask re-emerges in a celebratory mood, dancing to honor the deceased elder and to escort his spirit (sigha) into the world of the ancestors.\n",

      "large scale, bold color, or aggressive imagery ¿predatory animal references, horns, and strange tubular eyes¿each of these masks (1¿5) is a visually intimidating presence that harnesses the power of spirits from the wilderness as instruments of proprietary control in the realm of the town or village. Their visual affect was only heightened during performance. For example, Itrokwu (1), a massive horizontal mask in the shape of an elephant, is called the ¿king of mask spirits¿ by its owners, the ruling Ekpari clan of central Idomaland, Nigeria. Irokwu is a royal mask, indicated by its great size and imagery¿the elephant as metaphor for power. This metaphor is played out in the performance of the masquerade, which generates a high degree of tension. Its dance is ¿hot,¿ bursting onto the scene aggressively, knocking over food-drying platforms, scattering cooking pots and audience members, who remain at a respectful distance. The mask¿s royal status is also indicated by its accoutrements: it has its own stool carried by an attendant so that it can ¿rest,¿ and it is worn with a costume of high status, indigo-dyed burial cloth. So too, the impressive scale renders the Buffalo mask (2) an effective agent of the Kwifoyn society, an organization of elders and councilors who serve to support and balance the power of kings ruling the various kingdoms of the Grassfields region in neighboring Cameroon. Buffalo masks appear in large groups, along with other animal and human character masks owned by men¿s title societies. In contrast to the easily decipherable iconography of (2), the Wé mask (5) presents a bewildering accumulation of animal references: a fringe of aluminum-silver pseudo-leopard teeth, wild boar tusks, and pointed ears. With its bold color and bullet casings, this prototypical nature spiritmask is wild and menacing, making it a powerful judge during legal disputes and a great motivator of men preparing for battle. The Dan of Liberia once created many different masks to embody spirits of the forest. The tubular eyes seen on (3) suggest that it may be either a Zakpäi gä or ¿fire extinguisher¿ mask that helped to maintain social order in villages during the dry season, or a Glewa mask that kept order within the initiation camps of young boys undergoing the transition to adulthood. A policing function was also performed by (4), a Wan-zega mask from Burkina Faso. Wan-zega appear in groups at the onset of funerals, brandishing long flexible whips made from branches which they use to strike out at spectators. Their presence marks the uncertain period of transition when the deceased begins the journey into the spirit world. Later, the mask re-emerges in a celebratory mood, dancing to honor the deceased elder and to escort his spirit (sigha) into the world of the ancestors. 1.

The team will do spot research to check the heights of facades, the material of street surfaces, and the width of piazzas. The team will then proceed block by block, facade by facade, to create an immersive, walkable, correctly scaled, and detailed version of the Rome that Falda's etchings have preserved. Through Virtual Rome, museum visitors will be able to journey back in time to experience the Eternal City of the seventeenth century.

At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field.\n",

X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson's objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects. According to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0668.001-.010 were found in Box 65 and Box 66. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 65 contained \"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\".

      "A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance.  This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.

It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.

Many of the pieces have come directly from Tibetan diaspora families who requested that their pieces be kept in a sacred manner.\n",
      "Over decades, collector Alice S. Kandell acquired hundreds of bronze sculptures, thangkas, textile banners, painted furniture and ritual implements. Her interest in Tibetan art and culture began during her college years, when she took the first of many trips to Sikkim, Tibet and Ladakh. Throughout her career as a child psychologist in New York, she continued to pursue her love of Tibetan Buddhist sacred art, traveling, collecting, and documenting the art and culture of the region.\n",
      "In 1994, Kandell merged her own collection with that of Philip Rudko, a serious collector of Tibetan and Mongolian art for more than forty years, to create one of the most comprehensive Tibetan art collections in the United States.

One of these types of vessels was the nemset jar, a small, squat vessel with a spout, not unlike a teapot, used for pouring liquid offerings.

Manget The ancient Egyptians had a number of ritual vessels of specific form whose use date far back to the beginnings of pharaonic civilization. One of these types of vessels was the nemset jar, a small, squat vessel with a spout, not unlike a teapot, used for pouring liquid offerings. This example has been painted with blue bands to simulate garlands of lotus petals, and a solid spout modeled in clay has been added to the side. Nemset vessels could be made of pottery, stone , metal, or faience. Some, such as this one, do not even have functional spouts and were obviously never used for their original purpose. Permanent collection gallery: NEW KINGDOM FUNERARY ARTS In addition to objects of everyday life, graves of the New Kingdom (1550-1075 BC) were supplied with elaborately symbolic objects made specifically for burial. The imagery of the blue lotus flower, which closes at night and reopens its petals during the day, was a powerful evocation of rebirth. Garlands of lotus petals were sometimes draped on pots or painted on vessels. Lotus buds and petals were also copied for use as jewelry elements or architectural embellishments. Tombs were decorated with stone stelae depicting the tomb owner and his family and were inscribed with prayers for the afterlife. These stelae were set up in front of tombs or inside chapels situated above the burials or in temples to the gods. The beautifully carved stela here is dedicated to Tjery and his wife, Henut. The couple kneels before an image of the creator god Ptah and beneath, an image of the serpent goddess of the harvest, Renenutet. The inscription asks that they ¿might grant a good and long lasting life on earth, sweetness of heart, a good old age and a good lifetime in Memphis partaking of the offerings in the temple.¿ Necessities were also placed in the burial chamber. These could be food, household goods, or simulations of these.\n",

      "Dogs\n",
      "Because modern Western society usually thinks of cats and dogs in the same key—as beloved pets—this section addresses the role of dogs in ancient Egyptian life, religion, art, and writing. Evidence of dogs living alongside humans in Egypt dates back to the fifth millennium B.C.E. Often mistakenly identified as certain short-limbed breeds, or as salukis and mastiffs, most ancient dogs were mongrels.\n",
      "Egyptians observed the dog’s innate tendency to protect its territory, valued its skill at hunting and scavenging, and appreciated its loyalty and obedience. Accordingly, dogs were kept as pets, and assisted hunters, guards, shepherds, and police. \n",
      "Canine or canine-headed gods were worshipped as early as Dynasty 1. Because dogs and jackals primarily inhabited the desert edge—where most cemeteries are located—canine deities were seen as guardians of the dead who could lead spirits through the perilous Netherworld. The gods Anubis, Wepwawet, Duamutef, and others are well known from temples, tombs, and papyri.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorative Elements\n",
      "Ever present in Egyptian daily life, images of cats embellished a variety of objects and were employed as hieroglyphs. Combining the symbolic power of the animal with a practical purpose resulted in popular objects of daily as well as ritual use. Feline characteristics were believed to enhance an object’s function. Thus, furniture legs in the shape of feline paws or complete lions provided both beauty and symbolic protection. Because of the obvious links between fertility, sexuality, and beauty, cosmetic items commonly included images of the great protector of women, Bes. However, some commonly used objects seem to be decorated with images of cats simply for the delight of it. \n",
      "At least five different representations of lions and parts of lions were among the many animal-shaped hieroglyphic signs. These hieroglyphs (rw- “lion”; HAt- “front”; pHwy- “end”, etc.) generally avoid symbolism, but instead literally denote the represented animal (or its part) or the phonetic equivalent of a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Healing and Protective Gods in the Home and Beyond\n",
      "Male deities with leonine features, such as Bes and Tutu, were increasingly worshipped in the home in the later periods of Egyptian history. Their feline components linked them to the sun and signified protection. Often appearing together at home and in temples, Bes and Tutu were closely connected with healing and magic, and held influence over fertility, birth, health, and fortune. Although mostly responsible for earthly life, they also protected the dead in the Netherworld.\n",
      "The god Tutu, a complex divinity in charge of people’s fate, was depicted as a striding sphinx with a snake tail. As the “Master of Demons,” he harnessed their power for protection, or prevented them from doing harm.\n",
      "Represented in the form of a dwarf with a broad, leonine face as well as a lion’s mane, ears, and legs, the god Bes guarded people during dangerous times of transition. He was frequently consulted by women seeking his assistance during pregnancy, in giving birth, and in the care of infants. As a mythical protector of the child Horus, Bes was venerated in both private and official religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amulets\n",
      "Tiny images of felines and feline divinities were popularly worn as amulets, or charms, by both the living and the dead. They were believed to provide protection and assistance to their owners and also served to display one’s piety.\n",
      "Amulets in the shape of a lion-headed goddess extended the protection of a fierce divinity to the amulet’s owner. Because lions were believed to guard the borders between the worlds, lion-shaped amulets aided a spirit’s regeneration in the next world. Amulets in the shape of Bes, believed to be particularly effective during the perilous moments of transition, protected women through pregnancy and childbirth, and assisted the deceased in rebirth. Some amulets also expressed their owner’s wish to partake in certain features of a deity.  A cat-shaped amulet representing Bastet, for instance, extended the goddess’s feline fecundity to the woman wearing her image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goddesses of the Eye of the Sun\n",
      "Many powerful goddesses—including Mut, Sakhmet, Bastet, Tefnut, Shesemtet, Pakhet, Mafdet, Wadjet, and others—were represented as a lioness or a lion-headed woman. Perhaps aspects of the same goddess, these feline divinities had individual characteristics. Nevertheless, each was known as the daughter of the sun god, Re, and acted as the “Eye of the Sun.” The sun god’s might and wrath manifested as the fierce lioness. She protected him and helped defeat his enemies. The duality of feline aggression and caring protection was reflected in myths that told of a divine, raging lioness leaving her community and returning as a pacified cat. In one such myth, Re sent his daughter Sakhmet, in lion form, to destroy rebellious mankind. When he changed his mind, he was unable to stop the bloodthirsty goddess until she was tricked into drinking red beer instead of blood. Drunk, she turned into the peaceful cat Bastet and spared humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small Cats:\n",
      "The two most common species of small felines—the jungle cat (Felis chaus) and the African wildcat (Felis silvestris libyca)—were first domesticated in the Predynastic or Early Dynastic periods (circa 4400–2675 B.C.E.). \n",
      "The cat’s furry lovability and their care of kittens were probably just as charming to the Egyptians as they are to us today. In addition to being beloved pets, cats were valued for their hunting abilities, keeping mice, snakes, and other vermin out of homes and granaries. Some feline deities were thus seen as divine protectors who destroyed the gods’ serpent-shaped enemies. Because of the cats’ tenderness and fecundity, Egyptians also regarded them as embodiments of motherly care, often attributing feline divinities with nurturing and protective qualities. \n",
      "During the later periods of Egyptian history, large numbers of cats were bred in temples and mummified as offerings to the gods. Cats that were particularly important to their elite owners were occasionally embalmed and buried in their own sarcophagi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Cats:\n",
      "Many large felines moved to the less arid area south of Egypt due to climate change that took place around five thousand years ago, before the Egyptian state was formed. Those that remained in Egypt inhabited primarily the semidesert regions to the east and west of the Nile Valley. Despite being relatively rare, these magnificent creatures captured the people’s imagination. \n",
      "Lions, leopards, and jungle cats were feared and respected as wild and dangerous beasts. Whether hunting for food or protecting their cubs, lions display power, ferocity, and awesome swiftness, as well as majesty and grace. Because of these qualities, they came to symbolize both gods and pharaohs, the male lion’s impressive mane perhaps recalling the nemes-headdress of the pharaohs. \n",
      "While the prominent qualities of large felines linked them with royalty and divinity, many kings felt the need to demonstrate their control over these mighty animals by organizing lion hunts or keeping captured animals in zoo-like enclosures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cats were an integral part of life in ancient Egypt, both cherished and keenly observed. Lions were encountered in the wild, while smaller cats—first domesticated in Egypt—were frequently kept as pets.\n",
      "The Egyptians did not worship felines. They did, however, associate cats’ natural traits with the characteristics of specific divinities. Connected with the sun by their love of warmth and their generally red or yellow fur, felines were frequently identified with the sun god, Re, himself, who appeared in some myths as a combative cat. \n",
      "The sharp contrast between felines’ fierce aggression, on the one hand, and the female cat’s maternal instincts, on the other, represents a duality inherent in the Egyptian worldview. Because the domestic female cat’s fertility and motherly qualities associated it with both women and divinity, many peaceful, caring, and protective goddesses were represented as a female cat. Yet the Egyptians also admired domestic cats’ predatory tendencies and hunting abilities. \n",
      "The same duality is evident with larger felines. The complex role of the lioness incorporated both the aggression of a protective mother and her gentle love. Myths involving a ferocious lioness raging against enemies and defending her family abound in Egyptian mythology. In addition, powerful and majestic lions were venerated as symbols of pharaoh or manifestations of gods. \n",
      "Composite male deities with feline features gained increasing popularity in the later periods of ancient Egyptian history. Worshipped both in temples and in the home, these gods were seen as guardians of pregnant women and of children, as well as more general custodians of health and fate and protectors of important places.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCCM's installation of Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt expands the scope of Brooklyn Museum's original exhibit. It includes the approximately 80 pieces from Brooklyn's installation. To this it adds 23 objects from MCCM's collection, long-term loans from the Kelsey Museum and Lewis Dubroff, and additional short term loans from Joe and Sofi Lewis.\n",

Goddesses of the Eye of the Sun Many powerful goddesses—including Mut, Sakhmet, Bastet, Tefnut, Shesemtet, Pakhet, Mafdet, Wadjet, and others—were represented as a lioness or a lion-headed woman. Perhaps aspects of the same goddess, these feline divinities had individual characteristics. Nevertheless, each was known as the daughter of the sun god, Re, and acted as the “Eye of the Sun.” The sun god’s might and wrath manifested as the fierce lioness. She protected him and helped defeat his enemies. The duality of feline aggression and caring protection was reflected in myths that told of a divine, raging lioness leaving her community and returning as a pacified cat. In one such myth, Re sent his daughter Sakhmet, in lion form, to destroy rebellious mankind. When he changed his mind, he was unable to stop the bloodthirsty goddess until she was tricked into drinking red beer instead of blood. Drunk, she turned into the peaceful cat Bastet and spared humanity. Small Cats: The two most common species of small felines—the jungle cat (Felis chaus) and the African wildcat (Felis silvestris libyca)—were first domesticated in the Predynastic or Early Dynastic periods (circa 4400–2675 B.C.E.). The cat’s furry lovability and their care of kittens were probably just as charming to the Egyptians as they are to us today. In addition to being beloved pets, cats were valued for their hunting abilities, keeping mice, snakes, and other vermin out of homes and granaries. Some feline deities were thus seen as divine protectors who destroyed the gods’ serpent-shaped enemies. Because of the cats’ tenderness and fecundity, Egyptians also regarded them as embodiments of motherly care, often attributing feline divinities with\n",

A common feature of both Luba-Hemba stools and headrests is a wooden platform supported by the heads and fingers of human forms. This piece is more naturalistic than the best-known stool style of the area, carved by the Master of Buli among the Luba-Hemba with a characteristic long face and exaggerated features. Here the face, torso, and legs are carved in descending proportions while the arms are very prominent as supports. Also unusual here is the depiction of both a male and female figure rather than the more common female pair. The female figure further distinguishes herself from the male by a higher forehead, more protruding face, elaborate cicatrization on her stomach and scars on her cheeks. The male is adorned with a beard and a headband.

      "Through extensive overland and maritime trade routes, Mesopotamian cultural influence spread throughout the Near East, including Egypt, Syria and the Levant, Arabia, and even India. Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found all over the Near East from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India's Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive ¿intercultural style¿ with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents. More examples of ¿intercultural style¿ vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels or it may have been one of the first stops and a major consumer on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source area for chlorite. These vessels were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs.\n",

      "Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant. Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials would be heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which they would turn liquid and become workable. Colors were created by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic, multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was not original, but caused by chemical reactions that occurred during nearly two thousand years of burial in the earth.\n",

      "NEAR EASTERN GLASS.  Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant.  Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium.  These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable.  Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion.  The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years.\n",
      "It is unknown exactly when glass was first made.  Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC.  In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire.  This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design.  Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns.\n",
      "1-3.  The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia.  They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing.  These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod.  The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it.  The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards.  Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder.\n",
      "4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass.  Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights.  The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired.  In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together.\n",
      "5-40.  In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe.  This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling.  The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8).  This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied.  Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24).\n",

This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design.  Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns.\n",

They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing.  These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod.  The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it.  The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards.  Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder.\n",

Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights.  The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired.  In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together.\n",

In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe.

The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8).  This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied.  Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24).\n",

      "NEAR EASTERN GLASS.  Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant.  Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium.  These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable.  Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion.  The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years.\n",
      "It is unknown exactly when glass was first made.  Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC.  In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire.  This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design.  Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns.\n",
      "1-3.  The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia.  They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing.  These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod.  The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it.  The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards.  Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder.\n",
      "4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass.  Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights.  The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired.  In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together.\n",
      "5-40.  In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe.  This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling.  The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8).  This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied.  Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24).\n",

Permanent collection galleries: NEAR EASTERN GLASS Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant. Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials would be heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which they would turn liquid and become workable. Colors were given by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years. 1.

      "According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-.X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades.  At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H.

      "Precious Metal as Personal Adornment\n",
      "A hierarchy of precious metals existed in the ancient Andes: gold was preeminent, then silver, gilded copper, and lastly plain copper. Here gold tweezers (4, 5, 7–11), though diminutive, were highest in status, then the silver items (1, 2, 6, 12, 13), and finally, the gilded copper earspools (3). Gold always outranks the other metals because it does not tarnish or rust, while silver oxidizes and turns black, and copper turns green and eventually disintegrates. The immutability and reflective superiority of gold translates into social status throughout world cultures.\n",
      "Many items of personal adornment were made from precious metals. Headgear, often in the form of a crescent, may be decorated with felines and tied on with a thread (1) or take the shape of a stingray or skate whose tail penetrated the hair (2). These gave the wearer a more imposing silhouette and placed their shamanic spirit animals on their head, the appropriate location since visions are associated with the fontanel.\n",
      "Amerindian men genetically grow very little body hair, especially facial hair, encouraging the creation of elaborate tweezers (4–13). They utilize the natural flexibility of metal alloys, which bend to grasp the hair and flex to return to their original shape. Decorated with birds or different elemental shapes, they become artistic objects, sometimes called “art-tools” by scholars.\n",
      "High-status men throughout the indigenous Americas wore earspools (3), like a spool of thread pushed through a large hole in the earlobe. This pair features spiders in cut out webs, and traces of the gold layer over the now-green copper show they were originally gilded. The Moche identified with the spider, an animal that captures its prey and sucks out its blood—they took prisoners and ceremonially bled them from the neck, presenting a goblet of blood to the High Priest. Thus, someone who would wear these middle-status gilded copper spider earspools probably participated in such a ritual, but occupied a lesser position, perhaps someone who lead the prisoners.\n",

      "KAREL APPEL: FORM BECOMES VIBRATION\n",
      "\n",
      "\tDutch artist Karel Appel was one of the founders in 1948 of Cobra, an international avant-garde movement originated by a group of European artists in the wake of the Second World War.  Cobra was an acronym for Copenhagen,  Brussels and Amsterdam, the artists' native cities, all of which had suffered under Nazi occupation.  In reaction to the horrific oppression of the war years, the Cobra artists rejected all artistic and political dogma and sought an expression uninhibited by the constraints of reason.  Their interests paralleled other artistic movements of the post-war years.  Like l'art brut  (¿raw art¿) of Jean Dubuffet in Paris, the art of Cobra found its inspiration in the untutored spontaneity of folk art, the art of children, and the art of the insane.  Its instinctive and improvisatory approach was also akin to Abstract Expressionism in New York.  While the Cobra artists displayed a stronger interest in figural representation than their American counterparts, the apparent ferocity of the encounter between the artists and their materials is similar to that seen in the works of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning.\n",
      "\tIn response to the Dutch tradition in modern painting, Appel claimed the energetic expressionism of Vincent van Gogh as his own and disavowed the orderly, rational abstract geometry of Piet Mondrian.  Although the formal collaboration of the Cobra artists was short-lived (1948-1951), he has remained true in his work to the ideals of playful experiment and immediacy of feeling.  Over the years Appel has continued to depict the same childlike motifs-antic human faces and fanciful animals; but the style of their depiction has been constantly changing.\n",
      "\tThe works in the current exhibition were all produced within a few years of each other in the late 1970s.  At that time Appel adopted a new manner of expression using thick, parallel strokes of vivid, contrasting colors in both his paintings and prints.  Perspective and traditional modeling are totally absent in these works; both figure and background are built up with the same densely-packed welts of pigment.  Appel has described the rhythmic, emotionally charged-brushstrokes of this style, saying, ¿In my painting the form becomes vibrations, it enters the formless form, formless existence that I paint-vibrations of colors.¿\n",
      "\n",
      "APPEL ON APPEL\n",
      "\n",
      "In  1978 Appel defined his work as ¿the art of expressing something that is not really there. . . . It is embodied in a rhythm of colors which also embraces the beholder.  The brushstroke is of so much importance,  . . . to point something out which does not really exist. . . playful creatures, profoundness, jokes, sudden turns.  Loud colors are involved in portraying the present moment, all this in order to try to catch or hit on the essence, the true substance of things.¿\n",

      "Appel has explored the representation of intensely felt experience in sculpture as well as in painting.  Early in his career he began to make constructions out of discarded materials, the junk encountered in his daily travels around Amsterdam.  His assemblages of found objects evolved over the years into reliefs and free-standing works composed of strongly outlined shapes, cut from wooden planks in various sizes, painted in brilliant colors and superimposed upon one another.  Flying Fish  demonstrates the broad humor  that underlies much of Appel's work and tempers the violence of his expression.\n",

      "cities, all of which had suffered under Nazi occupation. In reaction to the horrific oppression of the war years, the Cobra artists rejected all artistic and political dogma and sought an expression uninhibited by the constraints of reason. Their interests paralleled other artistic movements of the post-war years. Like l'art brut (¿raw art¿) of Jean Dubuffet in Paris, the art of Cobra found its inspiration in the untutored spontaneity of folk art, the art of children, and the art of the insane. Its instinctive and improvisatory approach was also akin to Abstract Expressionism in New York. While the Cobra artists displayed a stronger interest in figural representation than their American counterparts, the apparent ferocity of the encounter between the artists and their materials is similar to that seen in the works of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. In response to the Dutch tradition in modern painting, Appel claimed the energetic expressionism of Vincent van Gogh as his own and disavowed the orderly, rational abstract geometry of Piet Mondrian. Although the formal collaboration of the Cobra artists was short-lived (1948-1951), he has remained true in his work to the ideals of playful experiment and immediacy of feeling. Over the years Appel has continued to depict the same childlike motifs-antic human faces and fanciful animals; but the style of their depiction has been constantly changing. The works in the current exhibition were all produced within a few years of each other in the late 1970s. At that time Appel adopted a new manner of expression using thick, parallel strokes of vivid, contrasting colors in both his paintings and prints. Perspective and traditional modeling are totally absent in these works; both figure and background are built up with the same densely-packed welts of pigment. Appel has described the rhythmic, emotionally charged-brushstrokes of this style, saying, ¿In my painting the form becomes vibrations, it enters the formless form, formless existence that I paint-vibrations of colors.¿ APPEL ON APPEL In 1978 Appel defined his work as ¿the art of expressing something that is not really there. . . . It is embodied in a rhythm of colors which also embraces the beholder. The brushstroke is of so much importance, . . . to point something out which does not really exist. . . playful creatures, profoundness, jokes, sudden turns. Loud colors are involved in portraying the present moment, all this in order to try to catch or hit on the essence, the true substance of things.¿ Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Whirling Head 1978 Acrylic on paper Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.2 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Big Head Coming Down Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.6 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Tibetan Bird Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.7 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 See Me Running Again Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.10 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Flying Fish 1977 Acrylic on wood Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.17 Appel has explored the representation of intensely felt experience in sculpture as well as in painting.

With Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in 333 B.C, new elements and forms of art were injected into local life. Hellenistic ideas and styles became the fashion until the Roman domination after 64 B.C., when a trend of standardization pervaded the Empire. The Romans provided the Levant an unprecedented level of security and prosperity. About A.D. 330, Christianity became the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the region, churches were built while temples were destroyed, especially in Jerusalem, and religious conflicts destabilized the Levant.

      "Archaeologists define Mesoamerica (“Middle America”) as the area roughly between present-day Mexico City and Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Although numerous cultures rose and fell there since Neolithic times, certain common features united them: solar and ritual calendars (11, 12), the world’s first ballgame (8), foodstuffs such as maize (14) and turkey (13), ritualized music (5–7), and working of rare materials obsidian (1–3), Spondylus (spiny oyster) shell (4), and greenstone (9, 10).\n",
      "The Mesoamerican calendars are very complex (see “Counting Time in Ancient Mesoamerica” at left). Two were shared throughout: the 365-day solar and the 260-day ritual cycle. Here two Maya vessels concern calendrics: 11 displays painted k’in signs, each denoting a day or sun passage, while 12 illustrates a date in the ritual calendar “7 Ahau.” The black background suggests the k’in signs represent time passing in the Underworld, a dark place of creativity and challenge. The “7 Ahau” also references the Other Side by being written backwards—Ahau (the face) uncharacteristically placed to the left of the bar for 5 and dots for 2. Key Maya monuments show reversed writing in association with shamanic visions and “7” represents reflection and contemplation, while ahau denotes the top, leader, and completion.\n",
      "The Underworld was also celebrated in the Mesoamerican ballgame, a ritual contest made possible by the early discovery of rubber along the Gulf Coast. The Maya ballcourt markers often show animals—8 is a monkey, a character from the creation story that takes place mostly in the Underworld. In this tale, two sets of heroic twins battle the death gods and create humans from maize, ensuring life. The Young Maize God (14) appears as a handsome young man whose crosshatched patterns represent kernels and long feathers drooping from his head symbolize corn silk. Scientific tests of residue inside this vessel confirmed it originally held maize.\n",
      "Music and art were highly developed. Effigy rattles (10, 11) depict elaborately dressed Maya women and a figural flute from Veracruz contains sliding interior balls to create glissando effects (7). Elites wore precious jadeite earrings (9) and greenstone beads (10) and ear ornaments made from the thin, red-orange lining of the spiny oyster (Spondylus americanus) (4). Jadeite occurred in only one source and Spondylus oysters clung to rocks deep in the Caribbean—both very hard to  obtain. Likewise, obsidian (volcanic glass) had few sources and great skill was needed to slice razor-sharp blades (3) from cores (2) and to chip spearheads (1).\n",

Bowls (1, 4, 8, 11, 12) held the staple maize cereals and gruels; in fact, scientific tests of residue left in 11 revealed maize.

A band of carved glyphs (7), painted glyphs (5, 10), or, interestingly, painted imitations of glyphs (6) is often found around the rim. Pretend writing can be seen as a form of social climbing: in a society with a low literacy rate the appearance of readable glyphs added some prestige to a \"middle-class\" pot. The currently untranslatable glyphs in 10 read \"hok\" and \"bok.\" Of the over thirty Maya languages, not all have been deciphered yet.\n",

(3), and from the calendrical date \"7 Ahau\" (4) to extruded eyeballs (9). The most complex scene (10) depicts a struggle between a snake, a seated god about to stab the snake with his bloody axe, and a spear-bearer (not visible here, as extensive modern overpainting was removed from his torso). This piece epitomizes the complexity, elegance, and subtlety of the Maya artistic vision.\n",

Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India’s Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive “intercultural style,” with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents.\n",

The recently discovered site of Jiroft in Iran also appears to have been a production center for these vessels, which were considered luxury products.

Permanent collection galleries: INTERNATIONAL_TRADE Mesopotamia Through extensive overland and maritime trade routes, Mesopotamian cultural influence spread throughout the Near East, including Egypt, Syria and the Levant, Arabia, and even India. Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found all over the Near East from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India's Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive ¿intercultural style¿ with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents. More examples of ¿intercultural style¿ vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels or it may have been one of the first stops and a major consumer on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source area for chlorite. These vessels were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs. The sandstone head was found near al-'Ula (ancient Dedan), one of the most important oases of Northern Arabia and an important camel caravan stop on the incense route that went from Yemen to the Levant. Originally part of a statue, this head may be associated with a Lihyanite sanctuary at the site dating to the fourth through third centuries BC, where similar male statues, perhaps representing deities, have been found. Mesopotamia was an important cultural influence on the development of the early Egyptian state, as indicated by ceramic and architectural styles and the use of both cylinder seals and a writing system. 1.

      "NEAR EASTERN GLASS.  Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant.  Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium.  These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable.  Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion.  The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years.\n",
      "It is unknown exactly when glass was first made.  Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC.  In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire.  This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design.  Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns.\n",
      "1-3.  The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia.  They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing.  These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod.  The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it.  The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards.  Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder.\n",
      "4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass.  Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights.  The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired.  In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together.\n",
      "5-40.  In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe.  This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling.  The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8).  This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied.  Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24).\n",

This revolutionized the glass industry, allowing for the rapid production of vessels in virtually any design. It also made glass a cheap commodity to be widely exported. Glass became mass-produced and was used to hold perfume and serve as tableware, lamps, cremation urns, and jewelry. The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of the vessels, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly 2000 years.

      "Some jaguar effigy vessels boldly convey the aggression of the animal itself, as in 1, while others less so (5-6).  By striking dark-light color contrast, a jutting three-dimensional head, and bloody red mouth, 4 captures the stalking and devouring prowess of the largest wild cat in the Americas.  The artist also introduced a subtle innovation: the spots are drawn as small abstracted jaguars, a motif not seen in other examples here.  In addition, the Pataky jaguar is shown as a shaman in animal form.  The hands-on-the-knees pose - which a feline cannot naturally adopt - is the quintessential symbol of shamanic meditation (and can be seen on images thoughout the ancient American galleries).  This piece also has rattling clay balls in the mouth and legs, re-creating the deep, rumbling growl of the actual jaguar.\n",

      "Painted designs 1-3 make reference to the ancient American king of the jungle more covertly. An inverted jaguar is depicted in the lower band of 1 and 3, its blood-red mouth and curving haunch serving as telltale features. Upside diwn images may refer ro the Underworld, believed to be the place where the transformation form jaguar to shaman occurs.  A twisted line motif is often paired with painted jaguar designs (2-3, with a more abstract version in 1).  This may refer, as it does in Mesoamerica, to the high prestige woven mat that leaders sit upon to symbolize their elevation above others.  The woven pattern on the arms of 5 likely makes such a reference.  In other Costa Rican styles (for example, the Belen in the pedestal at right) the twisted motif may even be integrated with the jaguar's tail, making the connection between the jaguar and leader obvious.  Another possiblilty is that the twisted lines stand for the spiral caapi vine which shamans use to induce trances in which they become their jaguar selves.   \n",

      "The charming Birmania effigy (4) can be seen as the most expressive in an almost sloppy way, yet  vibrant color and much detail were squeezed into its small format. Jicote examples (5), on the other hand, are the largest, accentuating asymmetry through tilting of the head. Like Birmania, however, the Jicote application of red paint seems hurried. As a result, felines in these two styles do not seem ferocious. By contrast, the Pataky example (3) is quite symmetrical and detailed, and is carefully, even elegantly, painted. It boldly conveys aggression, and its colors stand in sharp contrast to one another. The body pleasingly balances plain and patterned areas, and red blood drips from upper to lower canines. The artist also introduced a subtle innovation: the spots are drawn as small abstracted jaguars. This doubling of the jaguar's essence is a feature that other versions lack.

An inverted jaguar is depicted in the lower band of 2, its blood-red mouth and curving haunch serving as telltale features. Shamans believe the Underworld is inverted relative to the terrestrial world, a mirror-image cosmic zone where opposite things happen. This piece pairs the upside-down shaman in animal form with a twisted strand motif (two threads twisted). In nearby Mesoamerica the twisted strand is the prestigious symbol of the ruler, who sits on an elaborate woven or jaguar skin throne. In Costa Rica this pattern may substitute for a jaguar that is not even depicted (1). Artists often used shorthand to refer to a well-understood symbol such as the mighty jaguar.    \n",

      "The term Roman art does not describe one particular artistic style, nor does it define the art of a specific people or tradition. Rather, it is used as a general classification for the art produced under Roman administration, from the founding of Rome to the fall of the Empire, from Italy itself to the provinces ranging from Britain across North Africa to Mesopotamia. As the artistic expression of a civilization that spans several centuries and all areas of the Mediterranean world, Roman art exhibits a wide diversity in its artistic styles and standards. It is an art of contrasts-patrician and plebeian, public and private, pure and synthetic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roman art derives inspiration from a variety of sources, including native   Italic and Etruscan art, the indigenous art of the provinces, and Greek art. Fascinated with the classical past, Roman artists and patrons freely adapted Greek ideas, but in a fashion that transcends mere replication. Roman artists manipulated style to suit appropriate subjects or to meet the demands of particular patrons. Today we recognize Roman art as masterful in its own right, with its genius lying in its ability to control other styles to forge a characteristically Roman vision.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Roman artists worked in a wide range of materials, including marble, terracotta, bronze, and glass. They created monumental sculpture and architecture for public spaces (see the Corinthian capitals or the Togatus in the Carlos Court). Roman homes had elegantly crafted furniture, often inlaid or trimmed with precious materials such as ivory, gilt, and bronze.  Furniture handles were often fashioned in bronze in the shape of a lion's head (4), while the ends of chairs, tables, and couches could be capped with the heads of horses, lions, or bears (9). \n",
      "\n",
      "Ceramics from North Africa illustrate the creativity and virtuosity of Roman art in a provincial context. The distinctive North African Red Slip Ware, so named because of its glossy, red-orange finish, became one of the most sought-after commodities of the western Mediterranean by the late second century AD and greatly influenced the pottery produced throughout the Roman world for several centuries. The vessels in this case, some of which were produced by the highly accomplished Navigus workshop of Tunisia, bear motifs derived from Greek mythology, including the god of wine, Bacchus (8). The Romans were also keenly interested in animals (1) and native peoples (12). \n",

      "The term Roman art does not describe one particular artistic style, nor does it define the art of a specific people or tradition.  Rather, it is used as a general classification for the art produced under Roman administration, from the founding of Rome to the fall of the Empire, from Italy itself to the provinces ranging from Britain across North Africa to Mesopotamia. As the artistic expression of a civilization that spans several centuries and all areas of the Mediterranean world, Roman art exhibits an incredible diversity in its artistic styles and standards.  It is an art of contrasts--patrician and plebeian, public and private, pure and syncretist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roman art derives inspiration from a variety of sources, including native Italic and Etruscan art, the indigenous art of the provinces, and most notably, Greek art. Fascinated with the classical past, Roman artists and patrons freely adopted Greek ideas, but in a fashion that in many ways extends beyond mere imitation. Nineteenth-century scholars interpreted the diverse nature of Roman art as decadent or inferior, unfairly comparing it to classical Greek art.  Today we recognize Roman art as masterful in its own right, with its genius lying in its ability to assimilate other styles while forging something different, something characteristically Roman. \n",

      "1. The fragment of a Roman sarcophagus carved in high relief preserves the upper bodies of two hunters, one on horseback (head missing), who close in on a boar (only the head survives) that rushes to the right.  Representations of boar hunting appear frequently on Roman sarcophagi.  The heroized hunter, possessing physical strength, courage, and aristocratic stature, suggested the noble character of the deceased.  Often such scenes represent the great mythological hunters Meleager, Hippolytos, or Adonis.  Unfortunately, too little of this relief survives to determine if the original composition represented a mythological encounter.  As easily accessible sources of antique sculpture, scenes on sarcophagi considerably influenced Renaissance artists, who excerpted compositional elements to incorporate in their own work. \n",

      "The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000–1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (1, 2), Minoan (7), and Mycenaean (3–6) civilizations flourished.  The Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000–2000 B.C.) witnessed the flowering of Cycladic culture.  The Cyclades, meaning “those in a circle,” names a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea.  Situated between mainland Greece, Crete, and Anatolia (modern Turkey), these islands played a vital role in the development of Greek civilization through trade and communication with other regions of the Mediterranean as well as through their growth as a distinct island society, fostered by the relative isolation of the sea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The famous Cycladic “idols,” of which numerous examples survive today, are the most characteristic form of Cycladic art.  The so-called violin figurines (1) represent the earliest type of Cycladic sculpture, dating from the Early Cycladic I period of ca. 3000–2700 B.C.  The other figurine seen here (2) is of the so-called folded-arm type, a style associated with the Early Cycladic II period of ca. 2700–2200 B.C.  Both figurines are highly abstracted interpretations of the female form, the first emphasizing a woman’s reproductive regions and the second focusing on the proportion of the female body.  We know little about the original function of these statuettes, most of which were found in graves or settlements.  Presumably they possessed a spiritual or religious significance; scholars often associate them with burial practice or fertility cults.  \n",

Bronze or lead votive statuettes (7) are a characteristic product of Minoan Crete:  a male worshipper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration.  In the Late Bronze Age, the Mycenaeans established a trading empire stretching from Syria to Spain.  Distinctive Mycenaean stirrup jars (6), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean.  Although much about Greek Bronze Age culture remains enigmatic to us, we can appreciate many of their achievements, including the invention of early forms of the Greek language, the production of highly sophisticated works of art, and the construction of significant palaces and citadels. \n",

The Cycladic culture, which reached its zenith during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000-2000 B.C.), centered on a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea.  Small stone sculptures were among the most characteristic forms of Cycladic art, with the so-called violin figurines (11), highly abstracted depictions of the female form, representing the earliest type.  We know little about the original function of these objects, most of which were found in graves or settlements.\n",

The presence of figural decoration in ceramics and small sculptures signals a renewed interest in the natural world that remained central throughout Greek history.

      "AFTER:----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic, Minoan (5), and Mycenaean (1-4) civilizations flourished. Minoan Crete dominated the Aegean Sea from ca. 2000-1450 B.C., with the mainland Mycenaean Greeks acquiring their greatest power in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C. Although much about Greek Bronze Age culture remains enigmatic to us, we can appreciate many of their achievements, including the invention of early forms of the Greek language, the production of highly sophisticated works of art, and the construction of significant palaces and citadels. The collapse of the Greek Bronze Age civilization was followed by a \"Dark Age\" lasting about two centuries. Greek society began to reassert itself in the ninth and eighth centuries B.C., during which we witness an increase in population, the reintroduction of industry, the establishment of city-states, and a rise in foreign trade and colonization. This society created a new artistic style characterized by abstract geometric forms (6-10) which gives this early period of Greek history its name. During the Late Geometric period, the introduction of figural decoration (7, 8) signals a new interest in the natural world that remained central throughout Greek history, influencing the art of Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greece. Bronze or lead votive statuettes (5) are a characteristic product of Minoan Crete. Here, a male worshipper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration. In the Late Bronze Age, the Mycenaeans established a trading empire stretching from Syria to Spain. Distinctive stirrup jars (4), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean. On the Geometric high-rimmed bowl with ribbon handles (8), swastikas, checkerboard patterns, and lozenges decorate the rim, while below, zigzags and a meander decorate the bowl. The marsh bird and fish seen on this vessel reflect an emerging interest in natural forms. The export of Greek vases to Italy in the eighth century B.C. introduced the Etruscans to the Geometric style. The pithos (two-handled jar) (7) belongs to the so-called \"Heron Class\" produced in the region of Cerveteri. The birds pictured on the shoulder reflect Greek prototypes, but they are rendered with a fluidity associated with the Etruscan style. 1. Fragmentary Vessel. Greek. Late Mycenaean IIIA, ca. 1200 B.C.

      "The Aztecs are the most famous of the ancient American peoples, here represented by an earspool (1), a miniature mask (2), a lip plug or labret (3), and five spindle whorls (4-8). Turquoise (1) was a valued blue-green material imported from far away in what is now the southwestern U.S. The small mask is an Aztec copy of an earlier type from Teotihuacan. The Aztecs modeled their work after this earlier style copying it, as well as collecting it, to place as offerings underneath their pyramids. The lip plug is carved from obsidian and would have been worn through the skin below the lower lip; the larger back flange kept it in position. Originally this piece probably had a gold sheet metal cover on the front part.\n",

      "Aztec males were highly adorned, not only with jewelry but also with feathers and fine cotton textiles. The women made cloth, first spinning the cotton with the aid of spindle whorls (4-8). A long wooden stick, the spindle, had a small disk, the whorl, threaded onto it to hold the thread as it was twisted and wound around the spindle. These whorls have intricate designs on them: flowers (4, 5; art was called \"flower and song\" in the Aztec language) and solar disks as on the Calendar Stone (6-8).\n",

      "Andean Musical Instruments\n",
      "The ethereal sound of panpipes (3, 4), often accompanied by high-pitched flutes (1, 2, 5–8) and steady drums (9), is synonymous with traditional Andean culture. The music still played today has its roots deep in antiquity— the panpipes or antaras shown here were made nearly two thousand years ago. While modern panpipes are tied together sets of graduated-length, open-ended wood or reed tubes, the ancient ones are made of clay and each opening is closed at the bottom. Thus, the musician blew across the contained columns of air to produce different tones, a difficult feat. The two holes in 3 were for wearing the instrument like a necklace.\n",
      "Flutes, the other main wind instrument, include the Central Andean qena [kay nah] (8) that was played like a recorder, held in a vertical position with the notch upward. Fingering the holes produces five notes; this pentatonic scale is characteristic of all ancient American\n",
      "music (versus the European eight-note scale). This one is made of animal bone, which was burned (pyroengraved) in a decorative pattern of circles. It could also be worn; some cotton string ties remain.\n",
      "In ancient Colombia flutes (1, 2, 5–7) take different forms specifically mimicking shells, likely the first natural wind instruments. The large ones echo the shape of giant snail shells (1, 2), the smaller those of seashells (5–7). x-rays show that not only the exterior look of the shells was achieved but the interior three-dimensional spirals as well, so as to produce the exact acoustics of a real shell. This represents a prodigious artistic accomplishment. This impressive creative process signals a key Amerindian value, namely that images must be true to the subject and so finished on all sides, inside and out. Objects were considered to have their own life force and musical instruments in particular could communicate with the spirit realm in an appropriately invisible form. They could not achieve this if they were incomplete; in this case literally they would not sound right if they were not made like a real shell.\n",
      "Images of animals are also given the capacity of sound as in the bird on the four-chamber vessel (10). A whistling mechanism was built into the handle: air blown into the spout exits from a small hole behind the bird’s head. This difficult meshing of interior and exterior is another bow to the essential, letting the bird sing.\n",
      "Finally, drums (9) are found in a few Colombian graves,clay ones more permanent versions of the usual wooden ones (that rarely survive but sounded better due to the resonance of the material). Rhythmic sounds induce trance by changing brain waves, thus a drum is not only a pleasurable instrument but can be a spiritual\n",

      "Northern Andean Music  \n",
      "The importance of music in ancient American cultures cannot be underestimated, considering how many musical instruments remain in the archaeological record. Colombia was particularly rich in musical instruments, from chimes (1, 2) to flutes (3-7) to rare ceramic drums (8, 9). The proliferation of instruments may reflect the fact that rhythmic repetition and chanting sacred songs were essential activities for inducing trance states during shamanic rituals. According to scientific studies, drumming alters brain waves to create meditative states. Trances allowed the ancient peoples to contact the supernatural realm, receive its wisdom, and translate that knowledge into action. More generally, music, being invisible, was considered a suitable way to communicate with the unseen spiritual world. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stone chimes (1, 2) probably hung down from the arms or belt and clanged together to produce bell-like sounds during dancing (by analogy with the modern traditional Kogi who live in the same area of northern Colombia as the ancient makers of these chimes). The chimes have abstract bat shapes and so may refer to these nocturnal hunters who live in caves, which were seen as being in the Underworld.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other animals appear in flutes, which are made in the form of snails (3, 4) and seashells, and covered in imagery both geometric (3-5) and natural (deer [6] and feline [6, 7]). Geometric patterns are typically the first impressions in trance visions and so are not necessarily \"decorative\" but may be sacred designs. Trance visions may also involve the shaman's transformation into animals such as cats and deer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drums likewise emphasize the power of abstract patterns. Looking at the patterns generated from hallucinatory states can actually induce the visions to return. Therefore art with geometric designs has the power to summon the Other Side into this world, another way in which it is not merely decorative. One must imagine the hides of animals such as deer stretched over the tops and bottoms of these unusual drums (most drums are wooden, as they sound the most naturally resonant, but those do not survive long periods of burial). The taller drum would produce a deeper sound, the lower one a higher pitch.    \n",

      "Ancient Honduras\n",
      "Honduras was a dynamic cultural crossroads in antiquity. In some ways it related southward to Costa Rica, for instance, sharing a penchant for using clay stamps (1–3) to decorate the body. The central zone of Honduras, however, was quite independent of its neighbors, expressing itself artistically in a unique marble carving tradition (4, 6). Western Honduras lay in the ancient Maya sphere, part of Mesoamerica, with the great city of Copán at its heart. Certainly the artistic environment was rich in influences.\n",
      "The famous Ulua marbles, named for a river valley in central Honduras, were carved from the only source of marble south of Georgia. Its ten or more quarries yielded specific colors, now grayed from age and perhaps being heated in rituals; 4 was scientifically tested and comes from the southernmost Quarry “1.” The small chip visible in 6 shows the white marble as it looked when the piece was made. The vessels’ designs feature fantastical feline handles, derived from earlier ceramic precedents (5), and surfaces carved with repeating snakehead patterns. Like steam or smoke, spirals twist and turn all around them, evoking the typically reported visions in which wise spirit snakes advise shamans.\n",
      "Many Honduran ceramics relate to the Maya styles they encountered during the extensive mutual trade between the two peoples (Honduran chocolate for Maya salt). Tall straightsided cylinders are favored Maya chocolate vessel forms, though in Honduran versions the proportions are considerably widened and feet or ring bases (11) may be added. Designs sometimes stick close to Maya ones, such as the feather-bedecked person in 12, or feature Mayoid figures but veer into illegibility (7) and decorative repetition (8). References to Maya rim glyphs occur (11, 12), but are fanciful riffs on the prestigious foreign writing.\n",
      "Birds may appear naturalistically, as in the cormorant successfully fishing (10) or more blended with humans in cartouches (11), the nods to the Maya becoming obscure. Honduran individuality is apparent in all these works, such as the charming matched pair of stamps depicting jaguar-human shamans (3).\n",

      "The famous \"Ulua marbles\" (10) from Honduras are unique in the ancient Americas. As the only source for marble south of Georgia, in ancient times the Ulua Valley had at least ten quarries for the distinctive pink-veined marble. Scientific tests have pinpointed a quarry in the south end of the valley as the one used for this piece. The design features snake heads in profile, their swirling profusion perhaps symbolic of shamanic visions; the feline handles suggest the shaman's typical animal self. Ceramic cylinder vessels (14) may have provided the original form for the highly prized marbles or may imitate higher-status marble wares. Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture. Honduran artists took the dancing figures and glyphs of Maya vessels and transformed them into repetitive graphic designs (12-14). Non-Maya Hondurans seemed to favor references to prestigious exotica over faithful renditions of  Maya art. A subject such as fishing cormorants may look more Maya (15) or less so (11), showing that Honduran artists exercised considerable artistic freedom.\n",

      "Human figurines (4, 5) display elaborate headdresses and jewelry. Blue paint (traces remain on the left side of the headdress in 5) suggests that colorful clothing and body paint were also common. Stamps covered with pigments, being slightly concave, transfer designs well to a rounded human body. Frontal figures (9), trios of swinging monkeys (8), or pairs of jaguar-humans (6, 7) probably represented a person's animal self in the shamanic religious orientation of the ancient Americas.\n",

Thibadeau. Permanent collection gallery: Honduran Art The famous \"Ulua marbles\" (10) from Honduras are unique in the ancient Americas. As the only source for marble south of Georgia, in ancient times the Ulua Valley had at least ten quarries for the distinctive pink-veined marble. Scientific tests have pinpointed a quarry in the south end of the valley as the one used for this piece. The design features snake heads in profile, their swirling profusion perhaps symbolic of shamanic visions; the feline handles suggest the shaman's typical animal self. Ceramic cylinder vessels (14) may have provided the original form for the highly prized marbles or may imitate higher-status marble wares. Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture. Honduran artists took the dancing figures and glyphs of Maya vessels and transformed them into repetitive graphic designs (12-14). Non-Maya Hondurans seemed to favor references to prestigious exotica over faithful renditions of Maya art. A subject such as fishing cormorants may look more Maya (15) or less so (11), showing that Honduran artists exercised considerable artistic freedom. Human figurines (4, 5) display elaborate headdresses and jewelry. Blue paint (traces remain on the left side of the headdress in 5) suggests that colorful clothing and body paint were also common.

      "The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an under-lying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to metal, stone, and semiprecious, imported stone. Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\n",
      "During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\n",
      "Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\n",
      "The theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n",

      "The Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n",
      "2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n",
      "4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n",
      "6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n",
      "7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n",
      "10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n",
      "11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n",
      "13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n",
      "13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n",

      "The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an under-lying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to metal, stone, and semiprecious, imported stone. Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\n",
      "During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\n",
      "Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\n",
      "The theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n",

      "The Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n",
      "2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n",
      "4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n",
      "6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n",
      "7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n",
      "10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n",
      "11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n",
      "13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n",
      "13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n",

      "The Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n",
      "2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n",
      "4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n",
      "6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n",
      "7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n",
      "10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n",
      "11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n",
      "13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n",
      "13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n",

      "Jericho During the Proto-Urban-Early Bronze Age (ca 3300-2300 BC) Jericho's last major settlement of the Neolithic period (8500-4300 BC) was abandoned during the fifth millennium BC.  The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site.  Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.  Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain.\n",
      "The population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions.  Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy.\n",
      "Graves and burial offering provide most of our information about Jericho during the period.  Several generations of extended families or members of certain social groups used the same graves over long periods of time.  Burial chambers were hewn out of the stone faces of riverbeds, northeast of the city mound, and were generally used for multiple burials.  Pottery, jewelry and weapons were the most common goods deposited with the dead.\n",
      "Jericho's Early Bronze Age town flourished until the second half of the third millennium B.C. Along with other towns and cities in the Levant, Jericho was destroyed and temporarily abandoned.  The disruptions of the time may have been the result of drought, erosion, and deforestation as well as internal conflicts among the Levantine towns and cities.  Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho.\n",

      "5-8. Jewelry was a common offering in graves of men and women during the Proto-Urban period.  Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia.\n",
      "9. Although the period is called Early Bronze Age, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was virtually non-existent at Jericho.  Copper was sometimes used for certain tools and weapons including daggers or axeheads, but these objects were rarely deposited in tombs.  When the copper or bronze objects do appear in tombs, they are usually in the form of highly prized jewelry, rings, bracelets and beads.\n",
      "10-12. Animal bones with holes partially drilled into one end were deposited as offerings in some of the Early Bronze Age graves.  Though called by various names, including ¿idols¿, ¿dolls¿, or ¿cult objects¿, their function remains a mystery.\n",

Improvements in furnace design, however, allowed the glass to become thoroughly melted and made blown glass possible.  Thin walled glass vessels were produced and transported throughout the ancient word.

      "NEAR EASTERN GLASS.  Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant.  Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium.  These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable.  Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion.  The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years.\n",
      "It is unknown exactly when glass was first made.  Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC.  In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire.  This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design.  Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns.\n",
      "1-3.  The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia.  They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing.  These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod.  The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it.  The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards.  Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder.\n",
      "4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass.  Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights.  The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired.  In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together.\n",
      "5-40.  In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe.  This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling.  The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8).  This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied.  Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24).\n",

      "God Spoke the Earth: Stories of Genesis in Prints and Drawings focuses on the enduring narratives of the book of Genesis and highlights the breadth of Emory’s holdings in this genre. Drawn from the permanent collections of the Carlos Museum,\n",
      "Pitts Theology Library, and MARBL (The Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library), this exhibition includes a variety of artistic approaches to the ancient story of creation, from Albrecht Dürer’s famed 1504 engraving, Adam and Eve (The Fall of Man) to Marc Chagall’s 1960 lithograph, Bible II-Creation.\n",
      "The first book of the Torah and the Old Testament, Genesis recounts the origin and beginning of all things. It introduces the Judeo-Christian understanding of a monotheistic God who created and controls the world, and revolves around the sequential themes of creation, sin, re-creation, and redemption. These themes can be traced through the various stories of Genesis, from Creation through the Fall of Man, the Flood, God’s call and promise to Abraham, and more. \n",
      "The works of art in this exhibition span the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, and offer insight into how artists and communities throughout time depicted Genesis narratives and contemplated God’s relationship with mankind. A leaf from a twelfth-century French Bible, the earliest work in the exhibition, depicts a small scene of the Creation of Adam followed by an image of Adam and Eve eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, both in exquisite hand-painted detail. These pictures are followed by a New Testament image of Christ’s crucifixion, reminding the medieval Christian viewer of God’s ultimate redemptive act for the salvation of mankind. Alternately, several works in the exhibition reveal the political climate of the artist’s surroundings. For example, the inscription on a poignant seventeenth-century German drawing of Jacob’s Ladder may draw a comparison between the Redemption of Mankind and the Peace of Westphalia, which brought an end to the Thirty Years War.\n",
      "The title of the exhibition derives from the Creation Story recounted in the second chapter of Genesis, in which God speaks the creation of Earth and all living things. It denotes the mysterious, creative power of the Judeo-Christian God that has captivated and inspired artists, and offers a testament to the lasting importance of stories of Genesis.\n",

You have found an approach to the subject which must be called both daring and happy, a style that possesses a free and floating musical rhythm, without ever losing itself into the abstract, a style that is decorative and allegorical and which you master with great formal taste.

      "This fantastical series of watercolors by Joan Waddell-Barnes was created for an American edition of Thomas Mann’s novel Joseph and His Brothers. Mann conceived the work as “a triptych of fairly long short stories of religious tinge.” However, over a sixteen-year period, he expanded the brief biblical account of Joseph’s life, and that of his father, Jacob, into a complex, four-volume, fifteen-hundred-page narrative. He described this effort as “die Fleischwerdung des Mythos,” the transformation of myth into flesh.\n",
      "To prepare for this imaginative retelling, Mann drew inspiration from a multitude of source materials, including Jewish scriptural exegesis, astrology, comparative mythology, and the history of ancient Egypt. The political climate in Germany leading up to the second World War also influenced Mann’s epic tale. Though of German Protestant heritage, Mann, like many of his compatriots, was deeply affected by Nazi Germany’s genocidal treatment of the Jews. He fled to Switzerland after Hitler’s rise to power, and later, in 1939, emigrated to the United States.\n",
      "In 1942, Mann was introduced to the work of a young Joan Waddell, a student of Mann’s close friend, art historian Wolfgang Born. Born sent Mann two of Waddell’s drawings of Aschenbach, the main character of Mann’s Death in Venice. He was delighted by the drawings, calling them “intellectualized and surrealistic.” It is unclear whether Mann requested Waddell-Barnes to complete this series of illustrations for Joseph and His Brothers, or whether the artist volunteered her services. In any case, correspondence between the two confirms a friendship and both parties’ enthusiasm for the project.\n",
      "Waddell-Barnes’ expressionistic style also bends toward surrealism in these illustrations. For example, in Joseph’s Sojourn in the Well, the artist brings the primeval prototypes of a womb and a dead planet out of Joseph’s mind and into the reality of his surroundings. Likewise, Waddell-Barnes blends the forms of Joseph and his mother, Rachel, in Joseph Tries on the Coat of Many Colours. This stylistic choice was made in response to Jacob’s reaction at beholding Joseph, “It was the mother-goddess who stood there before him smiling, in the boy’s lovely guise….”\n",
      "A selection of twelve out of the series of eighteen illustrations, given to the Carlos Museum by the artist herself, are presented here. They beautifully capture Mann’s Amarna Period setting and what he termed a narrative of “love and hate, blessing and curse, fraternal strife and paternal grief, pride and penance, fall and rise, a humorous song of mankind.” Although Mann and Waddell-Barnes hoped these illustrations would accompany a two-volume edition of Joseph and His Brothers, it was never published.\n",

      "Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for thousands of years. Over millennia, a variety of styles and technologies arrived with the influx of new peoples who added to this artistic vocabulary, while in many isolated mountainous regions, motifs and techniques survived unchanged for centuries. Ceramic art production was focused in the north along the Elburz Mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros Mountains; and in the south and central lowlands.\n",
      "Characteristic of the ceramic vessels were elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts. Two types of surface ornamentation prevailed: painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds, and bulls, and a red-orange or gray-black surface color created by manipulating firing conditions in the kiln. Polishing or burnishing the pottery surface of both types before firing achieved a shiny, almost metallic sheen. Dark-on-buff painted ceramic decoration was preferred in the mountainous regions of western Iran.\n",
      "The ceramic industry of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, dates from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC. Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive burnished red or gray ware. Many of the vessels served a ritual function and were made in the form of bulls, deer, and gazelles.\n",
      "During the first millennium BC, the potters of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced beautifully painted beaked jugs and cups with dark-on-white decoration. Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals, were employed.\n",
      "Horse and rider figurines (other side of case) have been found throughout the old Persian Empire from Iran to the Levant. Their nickname, “Persian riders,” is derived from their headgear, a hat covering the chin and cheeks, which was the national headdress of the Persians.\n",

      "CERAMIC TRADITIONS IN ANCIENT IRAN.  Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n",

      "3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.

Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.

      "At some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n",

At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H.

      "At some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n",

      "Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically.\n",

      "X.0291 was located in Artifact Box #4.\n",
      "\n",
      "A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance.  This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n",
      "\n",
      "X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah.  I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0291. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 6\". The provenance description matches the Phillips Academy cigar box note for Box 6, so it can be presumed that X.0291 came from cigar box 6. As X.0291 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 6 originally contained X.0291, X.0301, X.0310, X.0351, and X.0625.001-.004.\n",

      "The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.  It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.  Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.\n",

      "with the education collection. Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically. X.0291 was located in Artifact Box #4. A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance. This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah. I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo. There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0291. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 6\". The provenance description matches the Phillips Academy cigar box note for Box 6, so it can be presumed that X.0291 came from cigar box 6. As X.0291 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 6 originally contained X.0291, X.0301, X.0310, X.0351, and X.0625.001-.004. The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994. It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here. It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from. Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier.

      "LAMPS OF THE LEVANT.  From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination.  The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops.  Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds.  The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel.  The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period.\n",
      "1-7.  The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC.  The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base.\n",
      "8-10.  The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions.  The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle.  Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market.  Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms.\n",
      "23-32.  The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods.  In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23).  Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs.\n",

      "At some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically.\n",

      "X.0670.011 was found loose in the plastic tub.\n",

      "NOTE: UPDATED 08/25/2021 with information from 1990 accession worksheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-.X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades.  At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\".  There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers.  The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson's objects.  It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects.\n",

      "not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically. X.0670.011 was found loose in the plastic tub. NOTE: UPDATED 08/25/2021 with information from 1990 accession worksheet. According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-.X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades. At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes. In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source. In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson's objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects. According to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0670.001-.011 were found in Box 63, Box 65, Box 66 and Box 72. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 63 contained \"1 pottery bowl, 5 large axe heads, 16 large game stones. Box 65 contained \"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\". Box 66 contained \"13 axe heads (assorted sizes), 1 game stone, 8 celts\". Box 72 contained \"1 pottery lid to jar, 1 large spearhead, 3 small axe heads, 1 large axe head, 1 mortar, 2 hollowed small stone, 37 game stones, 2 pieces fragmented pottery, Box #1 – assorted arrowheads, Box #3 - 40 arrowheads\". It is unclear with objects in X.0670.001-.011 came from Box 63, which came from Box 65, which came from Box 66, and which came from Box 72. January 1995 descriptor changed, was \"light violet\".

      "CERAMIC TRADITIONS IN ANCIENT IRAN.  Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n",
      "1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs.  The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC.\n",
      "3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.  Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs.  The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence.\n",
      "5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC.  Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware.  Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.  More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5)\n",
      "11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration.  Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed.\n",

      "An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran, bearing witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition that existed after the mid-third millennium BC. Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular supported flourishing metalworking industries: the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran. Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horse trappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature that displayed distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the lost wax technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by means of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horse breeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle, and horses.\n",

      "The Art of Metalwork in Ancient Iran.  An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC.  Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran.  Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery.  The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch.  The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders.  The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses.\n",
      "1-4. The rich tombs in the Gilan province of northern Iran have revealed large quantities of metalwork ranging from gold and silver bowls and beakers to bronze figurines of animals and weapons.  Daggers and spearheads of different shapes and sizes were extremely numerous and were left exclusively in graves belonging to men.  Unlike those at Luristan, bronze weapons lacked elaborate decoration and reflects an isolate, artistic tradition.\n",
      "8-15. The metalworkers of Luristan produced a wide variety of bronze objects which incorporated the stunning imagery of native animals and mythical beasts.  Animal forms ranged in style from natural to abstract and were generally cast or hammered into shape as zoomorphic handles or projections on weapons and tools.\n",
      "8. Since bronze required continual sharpening to maintain a useful edge, whetstones were an important piece of equipment used to hone the edges of daggers, swords, spears, arrows and axes.  Whetstone handles were often cast into zoomorphic representations or animals.  The ibex was the most popular choice, perhaps because of its most striking attribute - its sweeping curved horns.  In almost all cases, these were curved into a convenient loop from which the whetstone was suspended.\n",
      "10.  The importance of the horse in ancient Luristan is documented by the large number of surviving horse trappings and decorative harness fittings.  Cheekpieces, like this example, were attached to the harness bit and were often cast in a variety of forms ranging from horses, mouflons, and boars to mythical sphinxes, griffins, and master-of-animals.  Representations of figured cheekpieces appear on sculptured reliefs from Assyria, dating to the late eighth and seventh centruries BC, and indicate that these e fittings had a market outside of Luristan.\n",
      "11. At the turn of the first millennium BC, metalworkers often produced bi-metallic tools and weapons with blades made of iron and decorative elements cast in bronze.  This sword hilt's decorative elements consist of a circular pommel decorated with two bearded human and lion head and two crouching lions which form the dagger guard.  Nearly ninety iron examples of this sword type have been found and their complicated, unique, and nearly identical manufacture suggests a close association between the workshops in Luristan.12-14. Standard finials are the hallmark object of Luristan art and its bronze industry between the tenth and seventh centuries BC.  These objects were mounted on bottle-shaped supports by means of a central tube or pin and are meant to be seen from both sides.  Their iconography is striking, varying from rampant goats (12) and lions to the exotic master- or mistress-of-animals (13, 14) representations where abstract human-like bodies are fused with stylize lions, goats, birds, and mythical, fantastic beasts.  Only a few standard finials have been recovered from excavated tombs and sanctuaries and are best interpreted as representations of local gods, deities, or demons.\n",

      "One of Mesopotamia’s most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East was cuneiform (“wedge-shaped”) writing. In use for more than 3,000 years (ca. 3100 BC–AD 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record\n",
      "inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative, and dedicatory texts.

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: The Economy in Mesopotamia One of Mesopotamia’s most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East was cuneiform (“wedge-shaped”) writing. In use for more than 3,000 years (ca. 3100 BC–AD 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative, and dedicatory texts. Economic texts were extremely numerous, listing goods traded, wages paid, and rations distributed. These were measured in the ancient Mesopotamian units of ga, gu, or sa. In order for the documents not to be tampered with, important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope on which the text was recorded again and a seal applied. The Mesopotamians used sets of standard weights in conducting business. The weights themselves were usually made of a very hard stone like hematite. A simple barrel shape was the most common form, but weights in the form of ducks and other animals were also common. High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in Mesopotamia, and therefore, the majority of the stones used to manufacture vessels, cylinder seals, and weights had to be imported. Stone vessels were highly prized and were often used as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings. 1. Sickle. Mesopotamia, Ur. Ubaid, 4000–3500 BC. Clay. 1921.150, 153. 2.

      "At some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically.\n",
      "\n",
      "X.0288 was located in Artifact Box #4.\n",
      "\n",
      "A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance.  This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n",
      "\n",
      "X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah.  I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0288.  It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Shellman Site, 8 miles down Etowah from Tumlin Site\".  It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 13\".  The provenance description matches the Phillips Academy cigar box note for Box 13, so it can be presumed that X.0288 came from cigar box 13.  As X.0288 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created.  From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 13 originally contained X.0288, X.0289, X.0321, X.0331 and X.0601.001-.003\n",

      "The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.  It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.  Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.\n",

      "\n",
      "The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an under-lying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to metal, stone, and semiprecious, imported stone. Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\n",
      "During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\n",
      "Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\n",
      "The theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n",

      "Cuneiform Writing in Mesopotamia.  Cuneiform (¿wedge-shaped¿) writing was one of Mesopotamia's most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East.  In use for over 3000 years (ca. 3100 BC-ad 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative and dedicatory texts.\n",
      "1-6.  Many bricks (1-3) were stamped or inscribed with commemorative inscriptions bearing the name of the king.  Clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones (4-6) also bore commemorative building inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.  These were placed by the hundreds in the walls and foundations of temples and palaces.\n",
      "7-9. Letters of important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope, on which the text was re-recorded and a seal applied (7).  This precaution prevented anyone from tampering with the message by rewetting the clay and changing the inscription.  A similar precaution was used for all kinds of containers, sealed with a clay ball, on which the owner's seal was rolled (8,9)\n",
      "10-25.  All kinds of state employees were listed on clay tablets, with their wages, tasks, and rations measured in units of ga, gu, or sa (10-15).  Clay tablets recorded various aspects of agriculture including the sowing and the distribution of cultivated grains, or the collection of reeds (16-18).  The coming and going of livestock, particularly those destined to be sacrificed or offered for religious purposes, were recorded as well (19-25).\n",
      "27.  Scribes had to undergo extensive training in order to master cuneiform writing.  Trainee scribes first learned how to make tablets from clay and practiced writing cuneiform signs by copying short texts.  This example of a school tablet shows the same proverb written on one side by the teacher and copied on the other side by the student.\n",

      "Women’s shoulder mantles were held together by long straight pins called tupus [too poos]. Chimú versions (4–6) feature sculptural bird-figure tops. Inka tupus (1–3), however, usually have flat round tops. Larger tops (3) seem to have belonged to higher-status women, since Colonial images of the Inka queens show such oversized pins. More elaborate shapes (7–9), also shown in these documents, may represent Inka or Colonial pieces. New patterns applied to flat (10) and sculptural (11) tupus seem to be innovative Colonial interpretations. Ecuadorian versions (8, 9) are cast with double spirals.\n",
      "Precious metal dippers (12, 13) allowed lime to be spooned from a container; lime added to chewed coca leaves activates its properties of dampening hunger and increasing stamina for mountain treks. Like the tupus, lime dippers show cultural preferences: Chimú dippers often feature bird finials (12), while more elaborate Inka dippers (13) are often figural, such as a man paddling a crescent-shaped reed boat. The Inka being highlanders, the boat may refer to Lake Titicaca, considered the origin place of all humans, especially the Inka.\n",
      "Ceremonial tumis [too mees], knives with crescent blades and figural tops, were carried by Andean elites. Inka tumis (14, 15) often feature camelids, such as the Andean beast of burden, the llama. A mother and baby llama perch on a platform in one version (14), while the blade becomes the body, the shaft the neck, and the finial the head of a single animal in another (15). The Inka sacrificed llamas daily as offerings to various spirits and deities. They were precious, necessary animals that carried goods and provided fiber for clothing. Remnants of such a textile are visible on 15, indicating that this knife was once wrapped in cloth. An early Colonial tumi knife (16) features the lower leg and claw of a condor, the world’s largest raptorial bird, native to the high Andes of South America.\n",

      "ROMAN DEBT TO GREECE\n",
      "¿Greece, once captured, captivated its savage [Roman] conquerors and introduced her culture into the backwoods of Latium.¿ Horace's famous comment summarizes the profound debt Augustan Rome owed to the Greek achievement, which it explicitly tried to emulate (for example in Virgil's epic Aeneid). The ancient association between Greece and its colonies in southern Italy, or trade with Etruria, meant that many central aspects of life such as religious and mythological beliefs entered the Roman mind naturally. Greece flourished under Roman rule, and Greek was the language of the eastern part of the Roman empire. In art, various forms of indebtedness can be seen: sometimes straightforward copies of famous Greek statues (15, 17) or reliefs (2) were made; at others, the style may be classicistic but the compositions and functions Roman (5); at others, it is the mythological story, alive since archaic Greece, that is the linking thread (10, 12).\n",

      "The invention of drama in the late sixth century BC is one of the most enduring contributions made by the ancient Greeks to western culture. The enormous popularity of plays is attested not only by the great size and lavish decoration of the theaters themselves but also by the many surviving theatrical representations, especially the exaggerated masks worn by actors. \n",
      "\n",
      "The origins of Greek drama seem to be inextricably linked with Dionysiac ritual. Tragedy appears first in the late sixth century, when a convention emerged whereby a subject was treated in three parts (as in Aeschylus’s Oresteia). To these tragic enactments were appended, by way of light relief, a comic satyr-play, in which a tragic subject was turned on its head and treated farcically. In this environment, comedy was born. \n",

      "118C - THE POWER OF WINE \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, served as a refreshment as well as a transformative substance.  Its altering power, extolled by the followers of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine, was recognized as positive and negative.  It could transform the imbiber (drinker) into a state of exultation and freedom from cares, enthousiasmos, or it could turn destructive, changing an heroic character such as Herakles into a befuddled fool, causing him to blunder in the face of serious matters like death.  Herakles was renowned for his drinking in excess.  Both Dionysos, the giver of wine, and Herakles, the great imbiber, were popular subjects for the ancient Greek artist, particularly on vessels associated with the symposium (Greek drinking party), kraters (2, 3) for mixing wine, drinking cups of various styles (1, 4, 9), and bronze statuettes (7). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Herakles is seen as the central figure in the calyx krater (2) by the Chequer Painter, so-called because of his penchant for a chequered pattern on his vessels.  The semi-divine hero relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his desire for wine.  The elder satyr pours the liquid from an oinochoe (small pitcher) into Herakles’ kantharos (drinking cup), such as the one in this case (1). Herakles, identifiable by the lion skin draped over his shoulder, also appears in a drinking pose in the bronze statuette (7) in which he holds a cup in his right hand.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos' role as the god of wine was parallel to his role as the god of drama.  These roles were closely linked in the two basic and complementary.  Dionysiac experiences, ecstasy and enthusiasm.  The Greek word ekstasis, literally means \"to be beside yourself\" or \"to step outside of yourself.\"  In such a state one becomes an empty vessel into which the god may come.  This is enthousiasmos, or literally \"allowing the god to enter into you,\" and so transform you.  The god is embodied in the wine, and once Dionysos is inside a human body, individuals feel transformed into something other than what they normally are.  Likewise, in the theatrical experience participants give up their normal identity and by wearing masks -the emblem of the god-are transformed into something different. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos as the god of wine and drama as well as his other aspects were celebrated in public festivals throughout the Greek world, from the mainland to the colonies, from South Italy to the Black Sea.  Dionysos was also worshipped in mystery cults, which promised a blessed afterlife to his initiates.  Both because of his importance in Greek thought and the richness of stories associated with his revels, Dionysos appeared repeatedly in Greek art in various media, including vases, sculpture, and coins, from the early sixth century B.C. onwards.  He was first portrayed by artists as an older, bearded man (4, 9), only acquiring the image of a beardless youth after the mid-fifth century B.C. (2, 3). Various symbols associated with Dionysos in art include the rhyton (drinking horn) (9), the kantharos (1), the skyphos (drinking cup) (4, 9), masks, grapevines, and the thyrsos (fennel wand crowned with ivy and grapes). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The attendants of Dionysos, known as his thiasos, occur in Greek art on their own or accompanying the god. They were a wild and uninhibited group, including such characters as satyrs, men with horse features (4, 10) and ecstatic maenads, Dionysos' female companions (3, 4, 5). Other minor gods could join Dionysos in his adventures, among them Pan, the half-man, half-goat god of nature (8), and Silenos, a jolly older satyr known for his love of wine, women, and song (7).  These characters frequently are pictured as party revellers, participating in great drunken fests that have come to be known as Bacchanals, after the Roman name for Dionysos, Bacchus. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos, serving in a triple capacity as god of wine, drama, and the mysteries, was a favorite subject of South Italian vase painters. On 3, a krater by the Creusa Painter, the god is reclining on a couch as a maenad dances before him.  He holds a skyphos for wine and a lyre; other Dionysiac symbols, including a tamborine and thyrsos, surround him. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The statuette (8) depicts the half-man, half-goat Pan, a nature god of Arcadia who became associated with Dionysos in the fifth century B.C.  The son of Hermes, Pan was the patron of shepherds and goatherds; his realm was the forests and mountains of the wild.  Here, in a typically carefree mood, he plays upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention.  On the rare occasions when Pan was unhappy, he could be heard screaming from mountain caves; the fear this inspired in passersby became known as \"panic.\" \n",

      "115A - SYMPOSIA AND FEASTING IN ANCIENT GREECE \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In ancient Greece, the symposion, or drinking party, served an important social function, providing upper-class men with a private forum in which they could discuss ideas, enjoy the company of friends, and indulge in the pleasures of wine, sex, and song.  At the symposion, revelers reclined on couches while partaking of wine.  Entertainment could include dancing girls (1, 6).  Symposiasts could provide their own amusement by playing musical instruments, reciting poetry, or playing drinking games.  Although an occasion of fun and revelry, the symposion was also a highly ritualized event, with complex rules of etiquette to be followed by the participants.  The symposion was for example presided over by a single chosen leader, the basileus (king), and involved such ceremonies as libations for gods and heroes, acts of ritual cleansing, and the distribution of wreaths.  In a related event, the komos, revelers would form lively and often rowdy processions leading from one symposion to the next (2). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, was at the center of the symposion.  In large vessels known as kraters (1, 3), the highly potent wine was mixed with water, a sign of civilized culture; the Greeks believed that only barbarians drank undiluted wine.  Symposiasts drank the wine from drinking cups of various shapes, including skyphoi (4, 10) and kantharoi (9).  Not surprisingly, the vases associated with the symposion could themselves be decorated with symposion or komos scenes, either mythological or mortal in nature (1, 3, 4, 10). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as mortals enjoyed the tradition of the symposion, so too gods and heroes partook of wine and the feast in the realm of Greek myth.  The semi-divine hero Herakles was particularly fond of drinking (3).  On the Sicilian calyx krater by the Chequer Painter (so called because of the chequered pattern normally found on his vessels), Herakles relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his thirst.  The elder satyr pours the wine from an oinochoe (small pitcher) into HeraklesÕ kantharos. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The god most associated with the symposion, however, was Dionysos, who acted as the god of wine, drama, and ecstatic experience.  Just as Dionysos himself had many identities, both positive and negative, so too wine was viewed as a transformative substance, with both positive and negative qualities, itself embodying the god.  Predictably, Dionysos appears frequently in images of the symposion and komos (1, 4, 10), portrayed by artists in the Archaic and Early Classical periods as an older, bearded man (10) and in later times as a beardless youth (1). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In art and myth, Dionysos was joined by members of his thiasos, his attendants, a wild and uninhibited group that included such characters as satyrs, men with horse features (7, 10) and ecstatic maenads, Dionysos' female companions (1, 6, 10).  Silenos, a jolly older satyr known for his love of women and revelry, also appears in Dionysiac imagery (8).  In addition, the half-man, half-goat Pan, a nature god of Arcadia, was associated with Dionysos (5).  The statuette depicts Pan in a carefree mood, playing upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the symposion, the feast was a vital institution in ancient Greece, fulfilling both a social and a sacred role.  The custom of the public feast was linked to the rituals of animal sacrifice; after the beasts were slaughtered, the cooked meat was shared among participants and spectators of the rite.  Because the feast symbolized community and piety, it became a frequent motif in art, particularly on funerary and votive reliefs.  In this marble relief (2), a bearded hero holds a drinking horn (rhyton) and reclines as a woman, probably the man's wife, sits nearby and a naked serving boy draws wine from a vessel.  An adorant approaches from the left, and the architectural frame of the relief suggests a small building or shrine.  A partially preserved inscription recording the dedication runs along the architrave of the shrine. \n",

      "118C - The Power of Wine\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, served as a refreshment as well as a transformative substance. Its altering power, extolled by the followers of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine, was recognized as postitive and negative. It could transform the imbiber (drinker) into a state of exultation and freedom from cares, enthousiasmos, or it could turn destructive, changing an heroic character such as Herakles into a befuddled fool, causing him to blunder in the face of serious matters like death. Herakles was renowned for his drinking in excess. Both Dionysos, the giver of wine, and Herakles, the great imbiber, were popular subjects for the ancient Greek artist, particularly on vessels associated with the symposium (Greek drinking party), kraters (3,8) for mixing wine, and drinking cups of various styles (1,2,9).\n",
      "\n",
      "Herakles is seen as the central figure in the calyx krater (8) by the Chequer Painter, so-called because of his penchant for a chequered pattern on his vessels. The semi-divine hero relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his desire for wine. The elder satyr pouts the liquid from an oinochoe (smal pitcher) into Herakles' kantharos (drinking cup), such as the one in this case (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos' role as the god of wine was parallel to his role as the god of drama. These roles were closely linked in the two basic and complementary Dionysiac experiences, ecstacy and enthusiasm. The Greek word ekstasis literally means \"to be beside youself\" or \"to step outside of yourself.\" In such a state one becomes an empty vessel into which the god may come. This is enthousiasmos, or literally \"allowing the god to enter into you,\" and so transform you. The god is embodied in the wine, and once Dionysos is inside a human body, individuals feel transformed into something other than what they normally are. Likewise, in the theatrical experience participants give up their normal identity and by wearing masks - the emblem of the god - are transformed into something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos as the god of wine and drama as well as his other aspects were celebrated in public festivals throughout the Greek world, from the mainland to the colonies, from South Italy to the Black Sea. Dionysos was also worshiped in mystery cults, which promised a blessed afterlife to his initiates. Both because of his importance in Greek thought and the richness of stories associated with his revels, Dionysos appeared repeatedly in Greek art in various media, including vases, sculpture, and coins, from the early sixth century B.C.  onwards. He was first portrayed by artists as an older, bearded man (2, 9), only acquiring the image of a beardless youth after the mid-fifth century B.C. (3,8). Various symbols associated with Dionysos in art included the rhyton (drinking horn) (9), the kantharos (1), the skyphos (drinking cup) (2,9), masks, grapevines, and the thyrsos (fennel wand crowned with ivy and grapes).\n",
      "\n",
      "The attendants of Dionysos, known as his thiasos, occur in Greek art on their own or accompanying the god. They were a wild and uninhibited group, including such characters as satyrs, men with horse features (2,5) and ecstatic maenads, Dionysos' female companions (2,3,7). Other minor gods could join Dionysos in his adventures, among them Pan, the half-man, half-goat god of nature (4), and Silenos, a jolly old fat man known for his love of wine, women, and song (6). These characters frequently are pictured as party revellers, participating in great drunken fests that have come to be known as Bacchanals, after the Roman name for Dionysos, Bacchus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dionysos, serving in a triple capacity as god of wine, drama, and the mysteries, was a favorite subject of South Italian vase painters. On 3, a krater by the Creusa Painter, the god is reclining on a couch as a maenad dances before him. He holds a skyphos for wine and a lyre; other Dionysiac symbols, including a tamborine and thyrsos, surround him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statuette (4) depicts the half-man, half-goat, Pan, a nature god of Arcadia who became associated with Dionysos in the fifth century B.C. The son of Hermes, Pan was the patron of shepherds and goatherds; his realm was the forests and mountains of the wild. Here, in a typically carefree mood, he plays upon a panpipe, or syrinx, a musical instrument of his own invention. On the rare occasions when Pan was unhappy, he could be heard screaming from mountain caves; the fear this inspired in passerby became known as \"panic.\"\n",

      "\n",
      " The defeat of Athens by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War during the late fifth century B.C. brought an end to the High Classical period characterized by the achievements of Periklean Athens.  The fourth century B.C. witnessed not only a decline of Athenian supremacy, but also a general decline of the city-state (polis) as the dominant social and political institution.  The upheavals of this Late Classical period (ca. 400-323 B.C.) fostered a new emphasis on individual concerns.  Contemporary philosophy, religion, and art reflect these changes in society and ideology.  Fourth-century art and architecture appeal to the personal senses, emphasizing emotion, elegance, and decorativeness.  We can see this elegance at work for example in the bronze strainer (5), where the handles are formed as swans with gracefully curving necks.  At a later time, the strainer was converted into its present form, a small kylix (drinking cup). \n",
      "\n",
      " Whereas Athenian vase painting was neither as popular nor as proficient as it had been in the fifth century, South Italian and Sicilian artists actively explored  new styles  and themes  in their work, yielding a rich  and colorful array of vases.  In the calyx krater by the Chequer Painter (2), whose workshop seems to have been located in Syracuse, Herakles relaxes at a symposium with two satyrs.  The elder satyr pours wine from an oinochoe (small pitcher) into Herakles' kantharos (drinking cup).  The style of the vase reveals the taste for decorativeness and elegance favored by fourth-century artists and patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      " The two Apulian vases (1, 4), also from South Italy, reveal the fourth-century taste for theatrical subjects.  Here comic actors are represented; on the bell krater (1) the outrageous padded comic costume with swelling pot-belly, sagging buttocks, and enormous phallus can be clearly seen, while the small chous features a comic mask (4).  The comic actor shown in relief on the guttus (oil flask) plays the great hero Herakles, with club and lion skin, famed not only for his great labors but also for his thirst and appetite (compare the more serious image of Herakles on the calyx krater, 2).   The vogue for theatrical imagery, in both vases and sculpture, continued throughout the Late Classical period and into the Hellenistic age.\n",

      "Greek Theater\n",
      "Theater permeated ancient consciousness, its imagery appearing on everything from pottery (20) to marble funerary sculpture (6), waterspouts (1), lamps (15), and weights (13).  Herakles relines as a symposiast on (5), attended by satyrs, suggesting the world of satyr-play.  One has African features, a clue that the title was Bousiris.  In myth, Bousiris, king of Egypt used to sacrifice strangers to Zeus to avert a drought.  When he tried to sacrifice Herakles, he himself was killed along with his followers.  The story was treated both seriously and as a farce.\n",

L1984.1.28 118C - The Power of Wine Wine, a staple to the ancient Greeks, served as a refreshment as well as a transformative substance. Its altering power, extolled by the followers of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine, was recognized as postitive and negative. It could transform the imbiber (drinker) into a state of exultation and freedom from cares, enthousiasmos, or it could turn destructive, changing an heroic character such as Herakles into a befuddled fool, causing him to blunder in the face of serious matters like death. Herakles was renowned for his drinking in excess. Both Dionysos, the giver of wine, and Herakles, the great imbiber, were popular subjects for the ancient Greek artist, particularly on vessels associated with the symposium (Greek drinking party), kraters (3,8) for mixing wine, and drinking cups of various styles (1,2,9). Herakles is seen as the central figure in the calyx krater (8) by the Chequer Painter, so-called because of his penchant for a chequered pattern on his vessels. The semi-divine hero relaxes after his labors as two satyrs attend to his desire for wine. The elder satyr pouts the liquid from an oinochoe (smal pitcher) into Herakles' kantharos (drinking cup), such as the one in this case\n",

      "LAMPS OF THE LEVANT.  From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination.  The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops.  Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds.  The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel.  The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period.\n",
      "1-7.  The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC.  The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base.\n",
      "8-10.  The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions.  The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle.  Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market.  Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms.\n",
      "23-32.  The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods.  In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23).  Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs.\n",

      "Jericho During the Intermediate Early  Bronze-Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2300-2000 BC)  Jericho's thriving town and distinctive Early Bronze Age culture disappeared with the destruction and brief abandonment of the site around 2300 B.C.  A smaller and sonewhat poorer village replaced the earlier town.  Its population displayed a radically different lifestyle, social character and materiel culture with seemingly few cultural ties to the previous Early Bronze and later Middle Bronze Age populations.  This marked change prompted Kathleen Kenyon, and excavator of the site, to call this culture \"intermediate\".\n",
      "Jericho's new settlers did not construct a walled town, but built encampments on the slopes of the city mound and an adjoining hill.  Little surviving architecture was left, suggesting that part of the population was semi-nomadic, relying on seasonal herding and limited agriculture.\n",
      "The skill and industry lacking in architecture seems to have been employed in constructing tombs which, unlike the previous period, were made and used for individual burials.  Tomnbs consisted of rock-cut vertical shafts whic hlead to underground burial chambers that differered in shape and size.  Some of the largest tombs were enormous, having required the extractions of some 50 tons of stone and representing a remarkable undertaking for a single burial.  Burial was clearly an important matter to Jericho's population but, surprisingly, only a small number of offerings of beads, pins, copper daggers, spearheads, or pottery were deposited.  The variety of tomb types, burial methods (primary and secondary), and the preferences for certain offerings suggest there were changes in burial customs  over time or that related groups with different customs lived side by side at the site.\n",
      "It is difficult to isolated the origins of this distinct population at Jericho.  The types of pottery shapes and metal objects seem to derive rom a combination of indigenous Early Bronze Age forms and innovative traditions from northern Syria.  Jericho's population could have been a combination of new people migrating to the site from northern Syria, remnants of the previous population who adopted new traditions, or pastoral and semi-nomadic tribes who thrived in the vacuum created by the collapse of the Early Bronze Age town.  Whatever the origins, it is clear that after 300 years, Jericho's Intermediate Early Bronze-Middle Bronze Age settlement and culture ended with the unmistakable arrival of new groups of people.\n",
      "1-9.  Pottery recovered from tombs during the period are clues to the origins of the new population living in Jericho.  The use of flat bases, ledge handles, and the incised and way comb decoration around vessel necks (1-7) continued local traditions from previous periods.  However, the absence of red slip and burnishing and the appearance of new shape including cups, bowls, jugs, jars (8), and lamps (9), suggests the incfluence of new pottery traditions from northern Syria.  Jericho's potters were more proficient during this period, using a faster potter's wheel to produce the rims and necks of vessels, while continuing to make the body and base by hand.  Called a \"teapot\" (3) because of its low body, wide neck and single spout, this vessel shpae appeared throughout the Levant during the period.  Painted teapots originated in northern Syria and were imitated by potters at Jericho, who produced their locat varient of the form.\n",
      "8.  This jar was found in a \"pottery tomb\", so called since the principal offering in the tomb was pottery.  Some of the pottery shapes in this tomb type appeared nowhere else on the site and may have been made specifically for funerary purposes. \n",
      "9. Four-spouted lamps are a hallmark object for the period.  Lamps were usually found on the floors of tombs, perhaps left symbolically to provide light for the dead.  Small niches hewn into the tomb walls were usually smoke-blackened and indicate at lighted lamps had been placed in them.\n",
      "10-12. Copper daggers, riveted to wooden handles that no longer survive, were often left as the sole offering in burials of men during the period.  Beads and pins were deposited exclusively in female burials.\n",

From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination. The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops. Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds. The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel. The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period. 1-7. The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC. The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base. 8-10. The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions. The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle. Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market. Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms. 23-32. The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods. In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23). Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs. 1,2. Four-Spouted Lamps. Levant, Jericho, Tomb P24 and Tomb J28.

      "In antiquity the distinction between “Costa Rica” and “Panamá” did not exist. However, chiefdoms do differ one to the next and even close neighbors can be distinguished by their particular artistic choices. Thus, the art of central and northern Costa Rica is quite\n",
      "distinct from that of central and western Panama.\n",
      "An obvious element differentiating Panamanian art is the unique purple slip (liquid clay colored with mineral pigments), best seen in 7. In addition, the pedestal plate form (5, 9), in which a tall tapering stand elevates a slightly concave plate, is also characteristic. They may\n",
      "evoke the natural shape of mushrooms, some of which have concave caps, and many of which produce visions. Interestingly, one of the pervasive effects of sacred mushrooms is seeing very small spirit beings; perhaps the miniature pedestal plates reflect this. The bases of plates often have snake-like diamond patterning, while the large plate (5) depicts crocodile/jaguars in almond-shaped zones. These fantastical animals face two directions, so one is perpetually upside down. All these features reflect shamanic principles: the seeing of snakes everywhere, combining of animal spirits, shamans inverting on the Other Side, and everything spinning during visions.\n",
      "The Costa Rican bowl (12) shows two heads on a splayed body, a similar inversion. Such tripod forms (8, 12) are much more common in Costa Rican art. While not always the case, Costa Rican art tends to be more sculptural—the two crab images display this, 8 being Costa Rican and 7 Panamanian, as do miniature vessels (9–12).\n",
      "Finally, Panamanian can be more abstract than neighboring styles: the miniature vessel (10) displays tiny almond-shaped patterns like those in 5, inside of which are the essential curves of the crocodile/jaguars. Shorthand and reductive, like the concentric circles of the crab’s back in 7, Panamanian styles avoid the detail packed into thed iminutive Costa Rican figure (11).\n",
      "Chiefdoms encourage artistic individuality, since leaders keep power only by persuasion. Art serves to display wealth, control over the most inventive artists, and the ability to trade with other elites by collecting exotic styles. Competition in the social realm leads to the same in the artistic, so the tiniest miniatures, the most elaborately painted vessels, or the most unusual slip colors aggrandize both makers and owners.\n",

      "shamans inverting on the Other Side, and everything spinning during visions. The Costa Rican bowl (12) shows two heads on a splayed body, a similar inversion. Such tripod forms (8, 12) are much more common in Costa Rican art. While not always the case, Costa Rican art tends to be more sculptural—the two crab images display this, 8 being Costa Rican and 7 Panamanian, as do miniature vessels (9–12). Finally, Panamanian can be more abstract than neighboring styles: the miniature vessel (10) displays tiny almond-shaped patterns like those in 5, inside of which are the essential curves of the crocodile/jaguars. Shorthand and reductive, like the concentric circles of the crab’s back in 7, Panamanian styles avoid the detail packed into thed iminutive Costa Rican figure (11). Chiefdoms encourage artistic individuality, since leaders keep power only by persuasion. Art serves to display wealth, control over the most inventive artists, and the ability to trade with other elites by collecting exotic styles. Competition in the social realm leads to the same in the artistic, so the tiniest miniatures, the most elaborately painted vessels, or the most unusual slip colors aggrandize both makers and owners. 1, 2.

Nkisi were used by diviners and healers to contact benevolent spirits in the hope of curing illness, infertility, or other maladies. Small-scale figures such as these (2¿4) could also have served as diviners¿ insignia of office, or as curatives prescribed to remedy a client¿s problem through magical means.

The half-figure (3) was probably inserted into a small gourd containing a mixture of these substances, such as clay, vegetable matter, stones, fur, seeds, and horns. The formula according to which bishimba are assembled effects a mystical reaction, bringing spirit forces into play with the physical world. In this sense, nkisi are similar in concept to the nyama-infused amulets attached to the Hunter¿s Shirt displayed elsewhere in this exhibition. Songye nkisi (2, 5¿12) that serve to restore health, peace, fertility, and plentiful crops are called bwanga (medicine). The efficacious quality of bwanga arises from the belief that it was conferred to humankind by Efile Mukula, the Songye creator god, at the dawn of creation.\n",

For example, (5) was designed to protect a man during overnight journeys.

      "\n",
      "In ancient Costa Rica the utilitarian hand-held axe, or \"celt\" (1-3), used to clear land for agriculture, was the inspiration for a series of ceremonial necklaces created in more precious materials. The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine \n",
      "jewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w).\n",
      "\n",
      "What is most fascinating about making necklaces from axes is that the complete celt (4-6) was also subdivided in many ways and those pieces then worn as necklaces (7-17). This complex splitting process shows that the artist was able to make a complete celt and then to break it, despite the hardness of the material, so that the part still reflected its place in the original whole. The agricultural tool shape had to be honored since it was the key to the statement of power over nature made by the wearer. Half celts (7-9) are the front or the back face of a whole celt, made by carving a whole celt in from both sides until the front could be snapped off the back. The bumpy ridge, or septum, was left (9), as evidence of successful snapping. Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"mother\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"children.\"\n",

Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"mother\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"children.\" 1-3. Utilitarian Celts.

Thibadeau Permanent collection gallery: Greenstone Axes In ancient Costa Rica the utilitarian hand-held axe, or \"celt\" (1-3), used to clear land for agriculture, was the inspiration for a series of ceremonial necklaces created in more precious materials. The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine jewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w). What is most\n",

      "reductive, like the concentric circles of the crab’s back in 7, Panamanian styles avoid the detail packed into thed iminutive Costa Rican figure (11). Chiefdoms encourage artistic individuality, since leaders keep power only by persuasion. Art serves to display wealth, control over the most inventive artists, and the ability to trade with other elites by collecting exotic styles. Competition in the social realm leads to the same in the artistic, so the tiniest miniatures, the most elaborately painted vessels, or the most unusual slip colors aggrandize both makers and owners. 1, 2.

Permanent collection gallery: Art Tools of Costa Rica Costa Rican elite burials were filled with fancy, highly symbolic versions of everyday tools. From foodgrinding platforms known as metates (11, 12) to weapons such as mace heads (5-7), from hand axes used to clear land (8-10) to bark beaters used to make cloth (3, 4), utilitarian forms were transformed into \"art-tools.\" Changes from the practical tool to the work of art range from adding imagery, such as birds to a metate (12) or a human figure to an axe (10), to reducing the tool to a miniature size (7, 8). Much more time and skill than was \"necessary\" was lavished on an axe head (1, 2) or the handle of a pestle (14). Yet neither a tiny mace head nor a dull ceremonial axe can really function at all. These intriguing hybrid objects found throughout Costa Rican art seem to have been made in order to show the power of the high-status person over lower-status workers. Art-tools symbolize the woman?s grinding of flour, the warrior?s defense of his territory, and the farmer?s clearing of\n",

Another important assumption is that all phenomena relate in a series of analogies, often based on visual or functional similarities. Thus, animals can stand for humans (a carnivorous bird for a warrior, 2), and the animal food chain mirrors the human social hierarchy (a jaguar is above an ocelot, 4, as an experienced shaman is above a novice). This was a metaphoric equivalence (a shaman is a crocodile) not a simile (the shaman is like a crocodile). Shamanic experience includes humans freely becoming animals in a direct understanding of the unity of nature.\n",
      "The animal that is most analogous to human is a monkey (3), here resting its sleeping head on a vessel. The puma head vessel (5) is likewise treated like a high-status human, as the vast majority of Moche portrait head vessels depict important men. Pumas are\n",
      "associated with the highlands, whereas the Moche lived mostly on the coast. Thus, the exotic top feline of the mountains was elevated by portrayal in this format.\n",
      "Examples of the social analogy with the natural food chain are the osprey with his fish prey (2), and the ocelot (4) with a rope around his neck as if captive (human captives are shown in this way). His human eyes also suggest he is a shaman in animal form.\n",

Thus, it seems to be a symbolic image, representing war, shamanic ritual, perhaps both, since shell trumpets were blown before either event. Animals also combine with other animals independent of humans: 6 is both toad (eyes, mouth, body) and cat (ears, nose, and paws).

      "\" The Moche of the North Coast of ancient Peru created literally thousands of fine ceramic vessels with a characteristic \"\"stirrup\"\" spout, a type that had been invented long before in this area.  Moche artists employed a two-part mold, negative forms for the front and the back into which clay sheets were pressed.  The resulting halves were then joined to create the vessel body and a separate handmade arching spout was added to complete the piece.  Although the use of molds might tend to encourage lower-quality, repetitive works of art, this is not the case: the original vessel from which the molds were made was built meticulously by hand, the finishing of each vessel is so precise that it is almost impossible to find the seams, and the final slip painting and burnishing of the surfaces are uniformly excellent.  And, despite the generous number of extant pieces, there are many unique examples, such as this striking composition juxtaposing a barn owl, a boa constrictor, and a conch shell trumpet.    The barn owl is identified by its characteristic radiating eye feathers, its prey the boa constrictor by its markings, and the trumpet by the copper mouthpiece on the tip of a recognizable conch shell.  The exact meaning of this trio evades us, but certain possibilities can be suggested. Because of its accurate and ferocious nighttime hunting skills, the owl is an animal associated with both warriors and shamans.  Shamans work at night to defeat spiritual foes and would admire the seemingly magical way in which barn owls use their \"\"sight\"\" (actually sonar) to zero in on their prey, which they then decapitate.  Other Moche vessels depict owl-headed warriors and one an owl-headed female shaman curing a patient. Conch shell trumpets may have been blown in war and/or in ritual.

Owls are particularly key in shamanism, with their huge eyes and their ability to hunt at night. Yet this barn owl (Tyto alba) effigy (1) holds a snake in its talons and carries a shell trumpet on its back (note the copper mouth-piece).

      "The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an under-lying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to metal, stone, and semiprecious, imported stone. Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\n",
      "During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\n",
      "Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\n",
      "The theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n",

      "The Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n",
      "2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n",
      "4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n",
      "6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n",
      "7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n",
      "10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n",
      "11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n",
      "13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n",
      "13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n",

In order for the documents not to be tampered with, important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope on which the text was recorded again and a seal applied. The Mesopotamians used sets of standard weights in conducting business. The weights themselves were usually made of a very hard stone like hematite. A simple barrel shape was the most common form, but weights in the form of ducks and other animals were also common. High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in Mesopotamia, and therefore, the majority of the stones used to manufacture vessels, cylinder seals, and weights had to be imported. Stone vessels were valued and highly prized and were often used as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings. 1. Sickle. Mesopotamia, Ur. Ubaid, 4000-3500 BC. Clay. 1921.150, 153. 2.

      "Womb Vessels\n",
      "In pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\n",
      "A bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \n",
      "The other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\n",
      "Appliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\n",
      "Other images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual. These ideas of burying and digging up, the living accessing the other realms and the dead, reflect the deeply cyclical worldview of indigenous Amerindians.\n",

      "In pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\n",
      "A bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \n",
      "The other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\n",
      "Appliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\n",
      "Other images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual.

      "Ancient Honduras\n",
      "Honduras was a dynamic cultural crossroads in antiquity. In some ways it related southward to Costa Rica, for instance, sharing a penchant for using clay stamps (1–3) to decorate the body. The central zone of Honduras, however, was quite independent of its neighbors, expressing itself artistically in a unique marble carving tradition (4, 6). Western Honduras lay in the ancient Maya sphere, part of Mesoamerica, with the great city of Copán at its heart. Certainly the artistic environment was rich in influences.\n",
      "The famous Ulua marbles, named for a river valley in central Honduras, were carved from the only source of marble south of Georgia. Its ten or more quarries yielded specific colors, now grayed from age and perhaps being heated in rituals; 4 was scientifically tested and comes from the southernmost Quarry “1.” The small chip visible in 6 shows the white marble as it looked when the piece was made. The vessels’ designs feature fantastical feline handles, derived from earlier ceramic precedents (5), and surfaces carved with repeating snakehead patterns. Like steam or smoke, spirals twist and turn all around them, evoking the typically reported visions in which wise spirit snakes advise shamans.\n",
      "Many Honduran ceramics relate to the Maya styles they encountered during the extensive mutual trade between the two peoples (Honduran chocolate for Maya salt). Tall straightsided cylinders are favored Maya chocolate vessel forms, though in Honduran versions the proportions are considerably widened and feet or ring bases (11) may be added. Designs sometimes stick close to Maya ones, such as the feather-bedecked person in 12, or feature Mayoid figures but veer into illegibility (7) and decorative repetition (8). References to Maya rim glyphs occur (11, 12), but are fanciful riffs on the prestigious foreign writing.\n",
      "Birds may appear naturalistically, as in the cormorant successfully fishing (10) or more blended with humans in cartouches (11), the nods to the Maya becoming obscure. Honduran individuality is apparent in all these works, such as the charming matched pair of stamps depicting jaguar-human shamans (3).\n",

      "Ancient Honduras\n",
      "Honduras was a dynamic cultural crossroads in antiquity. In some ways it related southward to Costa Rica, for instance, sharing a penchant for using clay stamps (1–3) to decorate the body. The central zone of Honduras, however, was quite independent of its neighbors, expressing itself artistically in a unique marble carving tradition (4, 6). Western Honduras lay in the ancient Maya sphere, part of Mesoamerica, with the great city of Copán at its heart. Certainly the artistic environment was rich in influences.\n",
      "The famous Ulua marbles, named for a river valley in central Honduras, were carved from the only source of marble south of Georgia. Its ten or more quarries yielded specific colors, now grayed from age and perhaps being heated in rituals; 4 was scientifically tested and comes from the southernmost Quarry “1.” The small chip visible in 6 shows the white marble as it looked when the piece was made. The vessels’ designs feature fantastical feline handles, derived from earlier ceramic precedents (5), and surfaces carved with repeating snakehead patterns. Like steam or smoke, spirals twist and turn all around them, evoking the typically reported visions in which wise spirit snakes advise shamans.\n",
      "Many Honduran ceramics relate to the Maya styles they encountered during the extensive mutual trade between the two peoples (Honduran chocolate for Maya salt). Tall straightsided cylinders are favored Maya chocolate vessel forms, though in Honduran versions the proportions are considerably widened and feet or ring bases (11) may be added. Designs sometimes stick close to Maya ones, such as the feather-bedecked person in 12, or feature Mayoid figures but veer into illegibility (7) and decorative repetition (8). References to Maya rim glyphs occur (11, 12), but are fanciful riffs on the prestigious foreign writing.\n",
      "Birds may appear naturalistically, as in the cormorant successfully fishing (10) or more blended with humans in cartouches (11), the nods to the Maya becoming obscure. Honduran individuality is apparent in all these works, such as the charming matched pair of stamps depicting jaguar-human shamans (3).\n",

Scientific tests have pinpointed a quarry in the south end of the valley as the one used for this piece.

Ceramic cylinder vessels (14) may have provided the original form for the highly prized marbles or may imitate higher-status marble wares. Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture. Honduran artists took the dancing figures and glyphs of Maya vessels and transformed them into repetitive graphic designs (12-14). Non-Maya Hondurans seemed to favor references to prestigious exotica over faithful renditions of  Maya art. A subject such as fishing cormorants may look more Maya (15) or less so (11), showing that Honduran artists exercised considerable artistic freedom.\n",

      "At some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically.\n",
      "\n",
      "X.0309 was located in Artifact Box #5.\n",
      "\n",
      "A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance.  This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n",
      "\n",
      "X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah.  I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0309. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 41\". The cigar box note associated with Box 41 reads \"Pottery Fragments Tumlin Village Site and a few other objects\" As X.0309 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 41 originally contained X.0309 and X.0612.001-.002.\n",
      "\n",
      "The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.  It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.  Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.\n",

      "AFTER:----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "museum documentation was started. The \"education collection\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. Curator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed. The objects were returned to active status and their arrangements in the plexi boxes were documented photographically. X.0309 was located in Artifact Box #5. A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance. This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah. I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo. There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0309. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 41\". The cigar box note associated with Box 41 reads \"Pottery Fragments Tumlin Village Site and a few other objects\" As X.0309 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 41 originally contained X.0309 and X.0612.001-.002. The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994. It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here. It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came\n",

      "Crocodile Beings\n",
      "In nature crocodiles are formidable animals—hiding underwater then ferociously attacking—capable of killing with teeth or tail, yet also supremely fertile and caring of their young. In Costa Rica the most common is the Brown Caiman (Caiman crocodilus fuscus), aptly portrayed in brownware ceramics (2, 5, 6). It has a particularly bulbous snout, probably the inspiration for the noses shown as bumps (4, 6), spirals (3, 5) and fantastical emantions (1).\n",
      "Caiman raise their heads and tails when they “boom,” a very loud, deep mating call (it can be heard for over a mile); this pose is often portrayed (2, 4, 6). The pair of brown caimans (6) are flutes, thus the artist  appropriately positioned them to produce sound. They would have been ideal for fertility rituals, invoking how crocodiles mate in vast groups and produce large numbers of young.\n",
      "Effigies of men dressed as caiman in spiral-nosed masks (3, 5) support this idea because they adopt an expressly woman’s pose with their hands on either side of their belly. In female figures this gesture draws attention to the womb and frames the breasts, while here it suggests that shamans crossed gender boundaries in fulfilling their spiritual role (as they do throughout modern shamanic societies). Fantastical elements such as spiral eyes (3) and head protrusions (5) show that the supernatural aspects of shamans’ experiences are also being expressed. Shamans becoming their animal-selves during trances preoccupied ancient American artists. Other images blend the human with the caiman in other creative ways: in 2 human heads and arms protrude below the animals’ arching bodies covered in scutes (boney plates). The inverted diving position conveys both how these terrifying reptiles slip into rivers—to disappear and resurface menacingly— and how trancing shamans are considered to traverse all realms, including water and the Underworld, where they are like the crocodile hidden from view. A human head with crocodilian features, 1 pairs human verticality and ears wearing cylindrical earspools with prodigious zigzag teeth and spiral nose emanation. \n",
      "Crocodiles may carry cosmic symbolism as well, representing the earth’s surface and bridging watery depths, land, and air. In 4 the crocodile forms the base, literally and figuratively, for an elaborate tree-like trunk and branches on which jaguars perch. Jaguars do climb trees, yet here it seems more metaphorical—the crocodile earth surface yields the Tree of Life, with a human-jaguar (it has no tail) shaman climbing into the celestial realm. This tripartite cosmos and the shaman’s ability to ascend and descend the various levels at will is a widespread belief throughout shamanic cultures worldwide.\n",

      "Crocodile Beings\n",
      "In nature crocodiles are formidable animals—hiding underwater then ferociously attacking—capable of killing with teeth or tail, yet also supremely fertile and caring of their young. In Costa Rica the most common is the Brown Caiman (Caiman crocodilus fuscus), aptly portrayed in brownware ceramics (2, 5, 6). It has a particularly bulbous snout, probably the inspiration for the noses shown as bumps (4, 6), spirals (3, 5) and fantastical emantions (1).\n",
      "Caiman raise their heads and tails when they “boom,” a very loud, deep mating call (it can be heard for over a mile); this pose is often portrayed (2, 4, 6). The pair of brown caimans (6) are flutes, thus the artist  appropriately positioned them to produce sound. They would have been ideal for fertility rituals, invoking how crocodiles mate in vast groups and produce large numbers of young.\n",
      "Effigies of men dressed as caiman in spiral-nosed masks (3, 5) support this idea because they adopt an expressly woman’s pose with their hands on either side of their belly. In female figures this gesture draws attention to the womb and frames the breasts, while here it suggests that shamans crossed gender boundaries in fulfilling their spiritual role (as they do throughout modern shamanic societies). Fantastical elements such as spiral eyes (3) and head protrusions (5) show that the supernatural aspects of shamans’ experiences are also being expressed. Shamans becoming their animal-selves during trances preoccupied ancient American artists. Other images blend the human with the caiman in other creative ways: in 2 human heads and arms protrude below the animals’ arching bodies covered in scutes (boney plates). The inverted diving position conveys both how these terrifying reptiles slip into rivers—to disappear and resurface menacingly— and how trancing shamans are considered to traverse all realms, including water and the Underworld, where they are like the crocodile hidden from view. A human head with crocodilian features, 1 pairs human verticality and ears wearing cylindrical earspools with prodigious zigzag teeth and spiral nose emanation. \n",
      "Crocodiles may carry cosmic symbolism as well, representing the earth’s surface and bridging watery depths, land, and air. In 4 the crocodile forms the base, literally and figuratively, for an elaborate tree-like trunk and branches on which jaguars perch. Jaguars do climb trees, yet here it seems more metaphorical—the crocodile earth surface yields the Tree of Life, with a human-jaguar (it has no tail) shaman climbing into the celestial realm. This tripartite cosmos and the shaman’s ability to ascend and descend the various levels at will is a widespread belief throughout shamanic cultures worldwide.\n",

      "Art of Ancient Ecuador\n",
      "Ecuador, between Colombia and Peru, is considered part of the Northern Andes in ancient times, though it was partly conquered by the Inka in the sixteenth century. It was a very creative area, making female figurines (2, 3) and weaving cloth on looms (represented by the skirt depicted in 6) well before adjacent regions. Some of its practices relate to the Colombian and lower Central American cultures, such as secondary burial in large urns (1, 7) and roller stamped body decoration (5). Secondary burial means the deceased was allowed to decompose and the bones placed in giant vessels, which were then buried on the anniversary of the death. The face painted on 7 suggests the reanimation of these permanent body parts on the Other Side; indeed, the word for “bone” is the word for “seed” in this area, expressing the idea that the bones will grow another person.\n",
      "Many distinct styles followed one another in Ecuador, from the early expressive Chorrera [cho rare rah] (4, 8) dated 700–300 bc, to the later, delicate Jama-Coaque [hah mah co wa kay] (6). The seated Chorrera figure (8) shuts his eyes, holds his mirror necklace, and displays quids of coca in his cheeks, all indications that he is a shaman in trance (mirrors were divination tools and coca was used to maintain consciousness for lengthy rituals). The standing Jama-Coaque female effigy (6) represents a high-status woman in a turban, wrapped skirt, and gold jewelry. The clay slabs standing for cloth draping between her head and shoulders are impressive—clay dries at different rates and such suspended parts are prone to destruction from the moment they are created. Post-fired paint suggests the bright yellow headwrap and black skirt of a beautifully adorned young woman, whose arms show the imprint of patterns that may have been stamped, tattooed, or scarified on an actual person.\n",

      "In Northern Andean burials large ceramic urns were often used (1-3) for the deceased and their gold jewelry (4-6). After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"bone\" and \"seed\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"immortal\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n",

Permanent collection gallery: Colombian Burial Urns and Gold Jewelry In Northern Andean burials large ceramic urns were often used (1-3) for the deceased and their gold jewelry (4-6). After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"bone\" and \"seed\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant\n",

      "LAMPS OF THE LEVANT.  From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination.  The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops.  Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds.  The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel.  The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period.\n",
      "1-7.  The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC.  The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base.\n",
      "8-10.  The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions.  The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle.  Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market.  Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms.\n",
      "23-32.  The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods.  In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23).  Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs.\n",

New sophisticated equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high sea crossing was customary.  Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity as well as of navigation which played such a crucial role in colonization ventures and international commerce. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples.

      "\n",
      "First, to spin the thread, spindles (1-4) were carved from wood and spindle whorls (6-16) modeled from clay. A spindle is a thin, smooth stick that the spinner turns around to give twist to the strands of raw fiber. The spindle winds the thread onto its shaft above a bead or cylinder, a spindle whorl (3, 6-16). A bit of unspun fiber, wrapped around the shaft, serves to hold the spindle whorl in place (2). The spindle can be used as a bobbin (4), carrying the thread during the weaving process.\n",

      "Both spindles and whorls were decorated in the Andes. The spindles were painted with stripes (visible only before the thread was made or after the bobbin was emptied). The whorls were incised with geometric patterns. Like the \"invisible\" spindle decoration, the whorl's patterns are not seen by the spinner, as the decorated side is down. Andean cultures valued art that was not necessarily visible to humans, as part of their belief in the shamanic visions that were not accessible to most people.\n",

      "Weaving also necessitated tools, such as flat wooden battens (5), used both to pick up particular warp threads for elaborate patterns and to pack down the wefts to achieve a dense cloth. Carved at the wide end, battens were also treated as simple works of art in their own right.\n",

      "Womb Vessels\n",
      "In pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\n",
      "A bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \n",
      "The other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\n",
      "Appliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\n",
      "Other images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual. These ideas of burying and digging up, the living accessing the other realms and the dead, reflect the deeply cyclical worldview of indigenous Amerindians.\n",

      "Gender in Costa Rican Art  \n",
      "\n",
      "Both sexes figure prominently in ancient Costa Rican art, even within the same piece (1, 5). Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). \n",
      "\n",
      "Images that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have fit into the ring above their heads). Likewise, in 5, a large oval metate (grinding platform), the women form the legs that support the plate, most likely used for making maize into flour. Their hands rest on their bellies in a gesture of fertility (perhaps one of the messages of the piece being that the maize food nourishes the generations of mothers and children). Female images made into vessels (4) also explicitly combine human fertility (her navel is everted as in pregnancy) with plentiful food. The woman as a vessel for life is aptly conveyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tiny severed heads that encircle the metate's plate seem to represent the simultaneous giving and taking of life, in a probable analogy with the harvesting of maize kernels. Thus, through the metaphors of humans and maize the cycle of life itself is celebrated. The same kind of festive action in 1 may be related to the food stored in the pot above the dancers. Certainly in pre-industrial society a full food jar or a good harvest ready to be processed on a milling stone were key to survival and power. Men's and women's complementary contributions to this success were honored in ancient Costa Rican art.   \n",

An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness. Other images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual. These ideas of burying and digging up, the living accessing the other realms and the dead, reflect the deeply cyclical worldview of indigenous Amerindians. 1.

Permanent collection gallery: Gender in Costa Rican Art Both sexes figure prominently in ancient Costa Rican art, even within the same piece (1, 5). Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). Images that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have\n",

      "When the English poet John Milton called Athens ¿the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts and Eloquence¿ in Paradise Regained (1671), he echoed the opinion of untold generations who had looked on the city as the center of culture and civilization ever since its rise to greatness under the statesman Perikles in the fifth century bc. It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\n",
      "Five years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view.

      "In Northern Andean burials large ceramic urns were often used (1-3) for the deceased and their gold jewelry (4-6). After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"bone\" and \"seed\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"immortal\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n",

      "Colombian Burial Urns and Gold Jewelry  \n",
      "In Northern Andean burials large ceramic urns were often used (1-3) for the deceased and their gold jewelry (4-6). After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"bone\" and \"seed\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"immortal\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n",

Witten II. 2013 Reinstallation Label: Andean Art The ancient Andean cultural region encompassed the modern countries of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, plus parts of Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked. The Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). The brown open mouth with serrated teeth painted across her jaw aptly depicts the whale shark’s giant maw, filled with thousands of tiny, shark-like teeth. Even the white line down her back corresponds to the white edge of the whale shark’s dorsal fin. To have the powers of such a mighty animal —females, larger than the males, can reach over forty feet long—would have been impressive indeed. Colombia is renown for having one of the planet’s largest gold sources. The nosering (6), ear rod (5), and labret (4) mask the lower face by dangling a lightweight beaten gold sheet from the septum, decorating the earlobe with a cylindrical earring pushed through a large hole, and elaborating the area between the mouth and chin with an inserted flange, respectively. Gold, not only reflective but extremely permanent, defying tarnish for millennia, signaled elevated social status. Jewelry was buried with the body, in the widespread Amerindian belief that the soul went to an afterlife with his or her possessions. The large urns (1, 3) were buried containing the bones, the similarly permanent body parts, and the gold of the deceased. Expressing the deceased’s hope of being reborn on the Other Side, images of powerful females are typical in burial urn imagery. Here an egg-shaped pregnant women (3), her navel everted, and nude meditating female shaman (1) show different sides of female authority. With an accentuated navel as well as delineated genitalia, 1 shows that women also played key spiritual roles. 1.

      "Michael A. Smith, born in 1942 in Philadelphia, is a self-taught photographer who was originally drawn to the medium after seeing a television documentary about Edward Weston in 1965.  As he began to experiment with taking pictures, Smith came to understand that the camera could do more than simply document elements of the real world, but could also transform these elements into aesthetic objects.  Captivated by the clarity and detail that could be obtained with contact prints, he began to use view cameras early in his career.  Smith chose the path of ¿straight¿ photography ¿ he does not crop or enlarge his images.  When he wants to make larger images, he uses a larger format camera.  The gelatin silver prints in this exhibition were all made either with an 8 x 10-inch or an 8 x 20-inch view camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smith¿s earliest photographs were made close to home and concentrate on the details of his environment, revealing an interest in abstraction and all over texture.  In the mid-1970s Smith began to travel in the American West and shifted his focus to encompass sweeping vistas of uninhabited landscape.  In most of these images, Smith excludes the line of the horizon, thus maintaining his concern with the textural qualities of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "While on a picture-taking trip in 1978, he began to use the 8 x 20-inch view camera.  Puzzled at first about what kind of photographs to make in this new format, he found a book that represented bird songs with graphs that showed the progression of notes and intervals across time.  Smith realized that he wanted to make photographs ¿as beautiful as a bird song,¿ and he began to look for similar all-over patterns in the landscape.  In composing his pictures he had always been as concerned with the edges as with the center of the frame and had held a preference for a ¿dense and tangled¿ texture that would compel the viewer to scan the whole picture from end to end.  This, the inspiration of bird song, together with his interest in abstract form, led Smith to create these new documents of the American landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1980s Smith began to receive commissions to photograph urban environments in Toledo and New Orleans and elsewhere, but he was still drawn back again and again to the grandeur of the countryside.  In the last ten years he has journeyed beyond the United States to record the patterns of the Tuscan landscape, all the while revealing ¿wondrous transformations.¿\n",

      "UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY.  While the prospect of discovering submerged cities and sunken treasures has sparked the imagination of many through the ages, it is only in the last decades of this century that the systematic exploration of the depths of oceans and lakes has become feasible.  Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, have made possible the methodical exploration of underwater sites often less disturbed than those on land.  New sophisticated equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high sea crossing was customary.  Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity as well as of navigation which played such a crucial role in colonization ventures and international commerce. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples.  Objects in this case were recovered from a shipwreck off the Spanish coast, the island of Rhodes, as well as the ancient harbors of Syracuse and Caesarea.\n",
      "Although recovered off the Spanish coast, the shape of this amphora (storage vessel) (1) and its markings indicate that it came from Delos and belonged to a wealthy, local merchant.  The islands of Delos and Rhodes, because of their geographical location, were major Mediterranean trading posts and had a large production of amphorae  (1, 2).  \n",
      "Syracuse (3, 4). During its work on the ancient harbor of Syracuse (Sicily) in 1962, the Link expedition uncovered remains of a sixth century A.D. cemetery and the remains of a ship loaded with marble columns intended for a Byzantine church. A vast quantity of artifacts bearing witness to natural calamities and military disasters such as the destruction of the Athenian fleet in the third century B.C was also found at the site.\n",
      "Caesarea (5-10).  Strategically located on the Syro-Palestinian coast, Caesarea (in modern day Israel) has a history of active trade since 3000 B.C.  In 10 B.C., Herod the Great built a new harbor-city on this site in honor of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus who gave his name to the city.  As the capital of Roman Palestine, Caesarea rivaled Jerusalem in importance and splendor.  Due to changes in the water level of the Mediterranean Sea, structures of the ancient harbor had been covered by water for centuries.  The objects on display were recovered from the submerged harbor and surrounding waters during the Link expedition to Caesarea and the Sea of Galilee of 1960.  During this expedition, Emory Professor Immanuel Ben Dor and Atlanta Artist George Beattie accompanied Edwin A. Link, a brilliant inventor, who designed innovative underwater exploration vessels.

Tembladera and Cupisnique may share the formal approach to natural species - plant and animal - seen here, strong, but simplified, curvilinear shapes.  Post-fire pigment is also rather common among Tembladera pots.  Interestingly enough, a strong early connection between Tembladera and Paracas is suggested through certain forms and techniques of pottery fabrication.

Other than the use of the spout and strap handle on many Salinar vessels (others do have the stirrup spout), they can perhaps be differentiated in form from the Tembladera and Cupisnique wares by a less organic fusion of the animal represented and the vessel body itself.

Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked. The Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus).

      "From Aristocracy to Democracy\n",
      "The kingdom of Lydia was watered by rivers rich in alluvial gold, from which the world’s first coins were struck (14–16). Lydia was famous for its textiles and a perfume, bocchoris. The jars in which this was packaged, lydia (6) were distinctive in shape (borrowed from Egypt and widely imitated [10]), and in the marbled glaze that imitated stone vessels, both in Egypt and in Persia (8). Those in turn inspired Greek artisans (11–12).\n",
      "Lydian friendship with Greek neighbors (17–22) ended in 546 BC when the legendarily wealthy king Croesus (15–16) was defeated by the Persian king Cyrus the Great. Under Cyrus, the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire was fast becoming the most magnificent known\n",
      "(8–9, 23).\n",
      "Suddenly, Greek cities faced an ambitious neighbor. The Persian Wars, including two attempted invasions, simmered for fifty years (499 to 449 BC). In 490, the Persians lost at Marathon; ten years later, a second invasion prevailed at Thermopylae only to lose at Salamis and Plataea. The boost to Athenian morale from victory at Marathon cannot be exaggerated.\n",
      "Athenians led Greek resistance to Persia. Their autocratic ruler (tyrant), Hippias, had been expelled from Athens in 510 BC, taking refuge in the Persian court. A series of reforms under Cleisthenes shortly afterwards then widened the basis of power towards democracy. Fear of Persian invasion may have contributed significantly to the establishment of this new political model—the first the world had known. Athenian democracy was, however, extremely restricted: votes were cast only by Athenian male citizens. Foreign residents (metics), a substantial slave population, and the entire adult female population enjoyed no franchise. Under the democracy, artistic changes can be sensed in the increased number of vases that depict not myths but scenes of everyday life (1,3, 13).\n",

Burke Nicholson, Jr. 2014 Permanent Collection Installation label: From Aristocracy to Democracy The kingdom of Lydia was watered by rivers rich in alluvial gold, from which the world’s first coins were struck (14–16). Lydia was famous for its textiles and a perfume, bocchoris. The jars in which this was packaged, lydia (6) were distinctive in shape (borrowed from Egypt and widely imitated [10]), and in the marbled glaze that imitated stone vessels, both in Egypt and in Persia (8). Those in turn inspired Greek artisans (11–12). Lydian friendship with Greek neighbors (17–22) ended in 546 BC when the legendarily wealthy king Croesus (15–16) was defeated by the Persian king Cyrus the Great. Under Cyrus, the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire was fast becoming the most magnificent known (8–9, 23). Suddenly, Greek cities faced an ambitious neighbor. The Persian Wars, including two attempted invasions, simmered for fifty years (499 to 449 BC). In 490, the Persians lost at Marathon; ten years later, a second invasion prevailed at Thermopylae only to lose at Salamis and Plataea. The boost to Athenian morale from victory at Marathon cannot be exaggerated. Athenians led Greek resistance to Persia. Their autocratic ruler (tyrant), Hippias, had been expelled from Athens in 510 BC, taking refuge in the Persian court. A series of reforms under Cleisthenes shortly afterwards then widened the basis of power towards democracy. Fear of Persian invasion may have contributed significantly to the establishment of this new political model—the first the world had known. Athenian democracy was, however, extremely restricted: votes were cast only by Athenian male citizens. Foreign residents (metics), a substantial slave population, and the entire adult female population enjoyed no franchise. Under the democracy, artistic changes can be sensed in the increased number of vases that depict not myths but scenes of everyday life (1,3, 13). 1.Attic Red-Figure Lekythos Attributed to the Oionokles Painter.

      "Textile Art-Tools\n",
      "In Western traditions tools and art are usually categorized separately—not so in the ancient Americas. The term “art-tool” encompasses the assumption that the elaborate, intentional, and beautiful object performs an important action, or is based on a tool. The cosmos was conceived of as completely animate, as reinforced by the shamanic visionary experience that revealed the life force in all phenomena. Thus, the more active an artwork, the more it reflected universal law. Function and artistry therefore were complementary.\n",
      "Textile tools were highly elaborated and symbolically meaningful. Spindles—smooth tapered sticks that helped in the spinning of thread— were often painted (2–5), wound with unspun cotton (3) to secure carved and colorful whorls (4, 5), pierced disks that allowed thread to pile up on the spindle (8–22). Ancient American art does not always require an audience; its essential nature is more important, another reflection of the life force in all things.\n",
      "Colombian spindle whorls (16–21) were carved with geometric patterns on the underside. Likewise, Aztec whorls were carved underneath with motifs such as flowers (8, 9), sun disks (10, 11) and high-status frets (14, 15). The individuality of these beautiful tools was marked: the ones with flowers may well denote their specific owners, since in the ritual calendar a birthday that augured well for an artist included a number and the sign of Flower. Thus “3 Flower” and “4 Flower” were likely women spinner’s names, and these their personal art-tools.\n",
      "The most complex art-tools are battens, pointed bars used to pick up threads to produce complex patterns or beat down the last row of weaving to make a tight cloth. A Mixtec carved bone batten shows how a weaving tool may carry an intricate scene. Two figures face each other in the center, one with a spiral speech scroll to show talking to the other.\n",
      "Many such art-tools were buried during the Mixtec occupation of Monte Alban, indicating that important women—who were the weavers in that and most ancient American cultures—took their stories with them in this symbolic form. When buried with important men, carved battens may indicate funereal gifts from such high-status women. They may also indicate that among the Mixtec the metaphor of creation, rebirth, and the social “fabric” was carried by cloth and its production, as occurs worldwide. \n",
      "Women in the ancient Andes have been found buried with the “tools of the trade” for spinning, weaving, and embroidery—their workbaskets (23) and boxes (24). These were filled with combs to align fibers for spinning, spindles for making and containing thread, balls of finished and dyed yarn, and small bowls used to keep the ends of the spindles contained while making fine thread. These items, especially when blue and green thread is found (colors made with the challenging indigo dyeing process), demonstrate an accomplished weaver was laid to rest with this assemblage. A fancy carved wooden box was likely also used by a high-status\n",

These are very occasionally preserved in luxury media like silver (7), but much more often in ceramic fabrics, which include the first vitreous glazes (32), relief-ware (32-35) imitating metalwork, and marbled wares (36-37), imitating stone like giallo antico. Such colored stones were used not only for tableware but also furniture elements like table legs (39), and floor treatments like the opus sectile panel in the main gallery.

      "stones were used not only for tableware but also furniture elements like table legs (39), and floor treatments like the opus sectile panel in the main gallery. The table leg would have been placed at the center of a long side of a table whose opposite long side would have been set into a wall. Perhaps the biggest change is the invention of blown glass. The core-formed and cast glasses, including the millefiori series (most of 20-30) and the very rare cameo glasses (25), were high quality, expensive items: occasionally, for the very best, even gold could be introduced (2). These were gradually put out of business by the mass produced blown glass (12-17). A lump of this (22), from the famous glass-working centers of Tyre is a testament to the scale of production. 1.

      "In Western traditions tools and art are usually categorized separately—not so in the ancient Americas. The term “art-tool” encompasses the assumption that the elaborate, intentional, and beautiful object performs an important action, or is based on a tool. The cosmos was conceived of as completely animate, as reinforced by the shamanic visionary experience that revealed the life force in all phenomena. Thus, the more active an artwork, the more it reflected universal law. Function and artistry therefore were complementary.\n",
      "Textile tools were highly elaborated and symbolically meaningful. Spindles—smooth tapered sticks that helped in the spinning of thread— were often painted (2–5), wound with unspun cotton (3) to secure carved and colorful whorls (4, 5), pierced disks that allowed thread to pile up on the spindle (8–22). Ancient American art does not always require an audience; its essential nature is more important, another reflection of the life force in all things.\n",
      "Colombian spindle whorls (16–21) were carved with geometric patterns on the underside. Likewise, Aztec whorls were carved underneath with motifs such as flowers (8, 9), sun disks (10, 11) and high-status frets (14, 15). The individuality of these beautiful tools was marked: the ones with flowers may well denote their specific owners, since in the ritual calendar a birthday that augured well for an artist included a number and the sign of Flower. Thus “3 Flower” and “4 Flower” were likely women spinner’s names, and these their personal art-tools.\n",
      "The most complex art-tools are battens, pointed bars used to pick up threads to produce complex patterns or beat down the last row of weaving to make a tight cloth. A Mixtec carved bone batten shows how a weaving tool may carry an intricate scene. Two figures face each other in the center, one with a spiral speech scroll to show talking to the other.\n",
      "Many such art-tools were buried during the Mixtec occupation of Monte Alban, indicating that important women—who were the weavers in that and most ancient American cultures—took their stories with them in this symbolic form. When buried with important men, carved battens may indicate funereal gifts from such high-status women. They may also indicate that among the Mixtec the metaphor of creation, rebirth, and the social “fabric” was carried by cloth and its production, as occurs worldwide. \n",
      "Women in the ancient Andes have been found buried with the “tools of the trade” for spinning, weaving, and embroidery—their workbaskets (23) and boxes (24). These were filled with combs to align fibers for spinning, spindles for making and containing thread, balls of finished and dyed yarn, and small bowls used to keep the ends of the spindles contained while making fine thread. These items, especially when blue and green thread is found (colors made with the challenging indigo dyeing process), demonstrate an accomplished weaver was laid to rest with this assemblage.

In the exhibition, the sherds were placed in one of four groups, based the time period they were associated with.  This particular sherd was in group 3, Nabatean.  When the galleries were deinstalled, these sherds were placed in storage at MCCM.   No documentation can be found recording which exact box any of these sherds were pulled from for the exhibition.  There are no field numbers on this sherd, therefore, its original site/box information cannot be determined.

      "\n",
      "Much of photography's appeal lies in the perception that its images are a direct reflection of the world around us-a product of optics and chemistry that documents reality.  What may sometimes be overlooked is that the objective eye of the camera is governed by the selective eye of the photographer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practice of photography has always required a combination of art and science.  It is significant that, at the very beginning of the medium's history, the work of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson was a collaboration between a painter and a technician.  Throughout the nineteenth century photographers sought to define their work as a fine art analogous to painting or etching.  By the 1880s photographers who aspired to be artists tried to make their photographs as much like paintings as possible, using devices like soft-focus lenses to give an impressionistic effect, retouching prints by hand, and manipulating negatives through enlargement or cropping.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the twentieth century photographers reacted against this Pictorialist style and insisted that photography was a fine art in its own right, without reference to any other medium.  They began to probe the inherent qualities of photography and to find their subjects in contemporary life.  Modernists like Paul Strand advocated ¿straight photography.¿   This meant that final images were contact prints, the same size as the negative, using no enlargement, cropping, or any other manipulation by hand.  They were factual records, not artificial creations. \n",
      "\n",
      "A new genre of photography also appeared at this time, the social documentary.  Strand, following the model of his teacher Louis Hine, took his camera into streets early in his career to capture the less fortunate inhabitants of New York City. Leon Levinstein in the 1950s and Garry Winogrand in the 1960s have carried on this tradition of street photography, adding their own personal takes on the genre.  It continues today with yet another twist in the work of Larry Fink.\n",

      "In the course of only three years, Hill and Adamson were to make about three thousand photographs using the calotype process, the first photographic technique that, unlike the daguerreotype, used a negative, thus allowing multiple copies of an image to be made.  Theirs was a synergistic partnership with Hill the artist arranging the poses and lighting of each shot, while Adamson provided the optical and chemical expertise in wielding the camera and developing the prints.  Neither man on his own was able to achieve the same inventiveness and control that was evident in their collaborative work.  The collaboration ended only with Adamson's premature death in January 1848.\n",

      "EGYPTIAN HISTORY the ancient egyptians saw history as a cycle, beginning again with each new reign. As a result, inscriptions with the name of the ruling king are important historical markers. The king actually had several names, two of which were written in the oval sign for universal power, now known as the cartouche. Scarabs and amulets were often inscribed with royal names, but it is only at the very end of Egyptian history that we see coinage coming into use with portraits of the Ptolemaic and Roman rulers of Egypt such as the famous Cleopatra vii.\n",

      "Michael A. Smith, born in 1942 in Philadelphia, is a self-taught photographer who was originally drawn to the medium after seeing a television documentary about Edward Weston in 1965.  As he began to experiment with taking pictures, Smith came to understand that the camera could do more than simply document elements of the real world, but could also transform these elements into aesthetic objects.  Captivated by the clarity and detail that could be obtained with contact prints, he began to use view cameras early in his career.  Smith chose the path of ¿straight¿ photography ¿ he does not crop or enlarge his images.  When he wants to make larger images, he uses a larger format camera.  The gelatin silver prints in this exhibition were all made either with an 8 x 10-inch or an 8 x 20-inch view camera.\n",

      "Smith¿s earliest photographs were made close to home and concentrate on the details of his environment, revealing an interest in abstraction and all over texture.  In the mid-1970s Smith began to travel in the American West and shifted his focus to encompass sweeping vistas of uninhabited landscape.  In most of these images, Smith excludes the line of the horizon, thus maintaining his concern with the textural qualities of the land.\n",

      "While on a picture-taking trip in 1978, he began to use the 8 x 20-inch view camera.  Puzzled at first about what kind of photographs to make in this new format, he found a book that represented bird songs with graphs that showed the progression of notes and intervals across time.  Smith realized that he wanted to make photographs ¿as beautiful as a bird song,¿ and he began to look for similar all-over patterns in the landscape.  In composing his pictures he had always been as concerned with the edges as with the center of the frame and had held a preference for a ¿dense and tangled¿ texture that would compel the viewer to scan the whole picture from end to end.  This, the inspiration of bird song, together with his interest in abstract form, led Smith to create these new documents of the American landscape.\n",

      "In the 1980s Smith began to receive commissions to photograph urban environments in Toledo and New Orleans and elsewhere, but he was still drawn back again and again to the grandeur of the countryside.

      "Jericho During the Proto-Urban-Early Bronze Age (ca 3300-2300 BC) Jericho's last major settlement of the Neolithic period (8500-4300 BC) was abandoned during the fifth millennium BC.  The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site.  Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.  Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain.\n",
      "The population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions.  Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy.\n",
      "Graves and burial offering provide most of our information about Jericho during the period.  Several generations of extended families or members of certain social groups used the same graves over long periods of time.  Burial chambers were hewn out of the stone faces of riverbeds, northeast of the city mound, and were generally used for multiple burials.  Pottery, jewelry and weapons were the most common goods deposited with the dead.\n",
      "Jericho's Early Bronze Age town flourished until the second half of the third millennium B.C. Along with other towns and cities in the Levant, Jericho was destroyed and temporarily abandoned.  The disruptions of the time may have been the result of drought, erosion, and deforestation as well as internal conflicts among the Levantine towns and cities.  Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho.\n",
      "1-4. Pottery, with its different shapes and decoration, is our primary source for understanding the cultural origins, foreign influences, and international connections for the people of Jericho.  These vessels represent one of the three pottery traditions at the site during the Proto-Urban period.  Called Proto-Urban A, this tradition consisted of handmade bowls and jugs that were covered with a burnished or polished red slip.  Parallels with similar pottery traditions in the Near East suggest the influence of people from Syria and Anatolia.\n",
      "5-8. Jewelry was a common offering in graves of men and women during the Proto-Urban period.  Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia.\n",
      "9. Although the period is called Early Bronze Age, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was virtually non-existent at Jericho.  Copper was sometimes used for certain tools and weapons including daggers or axeheads, but these objects were rarely deposited in tombs.  When the copper or bronze objects do appear in tombs, they are usually in the form of highly prized jewelry, rings, bracelets and beads.\n",
      "10-12. Animal bones with holes partially drilled into one end were deposited as offerings in some of the Early Bronze Age graves.  Though called by various names, including ¿idols¿, ¿dolls¿, or ¿cult objects¿, their function remains a mystery.\n",

      "Metal objects, (see also Sicán Tumi and Earspools), corrode in burial environments due to exposure to moisture and salts in the ground.  Some corrosion can be very destructive, causing loss of surface detail or extensive damage.  Stable corrosion that forms on the surface can, however, be protective and may preserve evidence, including the weave pattern of textiles that were wrapped around the metal objects for burial.  The textile is replaced by corrosion pseudo morphs that reproduce the weave.  Close examination of the corrosion products on the large tumi revealed a weft-faced plainweave.  The organic fibers of the textile do not typically survive, but some fibers remain trapped within the corrosion products on the earspools and llama tumi.   Under magnification, using a stereobinocular microscope and transmitted light microscope, it is possible to see characteristic twist of cotton fibers.\n",

      "It may seem odd that a textile exhibition should include several metal objects. However, this ceremonial knife with a crescent-shaped blade (known as a tumi) shows clear evidence of having been wrapped in textiles in antiquity. This Inka tumi takes the form of a llama, the long-necked camelid that is the quintessential Andean pack animal, and remains of the cloth in which it was wrapped appear on both sides of the blade. The distinctive pattern of a plain-weave cloth—each set of threads going over and under the other—is now preserved in metal. An earlier Sicán tumi is almost completely covered with pseudomorphs. These “pseudomorphs”—meaning elements that have become part of a piece after manufacture—form during burial, when organic materials are either encased or replaced by corrosion products, retaining the form and appearance of the original materials within the mineralized layers. Pseudomorphs preserve the original weave structures, show the diameter and spin-ply of threads, and even suggest whether cotton or camelid fiber was utilized. Sometimes fragments of the actual ancient cloth survive within the corrosion, as seen on earspools with spider motifs. This wrapping of other precious objects expresses the concept of ukhu, the dialectic of hiding and revealing so important in the Andean tradition.\n",

      "Women’s shoulder mantles were held together by long straight pins called tupus [too poos]. Chimú versions (4–6) feature sculptural bird-figure tops. Inka tupus (1–3), however, usually have flat round tops. Larger tops (3) seem to have belonged to higher-status women, since Colonial images of the Inka queens show such oversized pins.

The Inka sacrificed llamas daily as offerings to various spirits and deities. They were precious, necessary animals that carried goods and provided fiber for clothing. Remnants of such a textile are visible on 15, indicating that this knife was once wrapped in cloth.

      "\" This Inca bronze ceremonial knife (tumi) features the characteristically long neck of the llama as its handle.  The llama, the largest of the New World camelids (ancestors of the Old World camels), has served for millennia as the key to human survival in the rugged Andean mountains.  As pack animals, as well as sources of hair, fuel, and meat, llamas helped the Inca expand their empire into the largest in the Renaissance world.  Thus, they form a fittingly significant subject for a ritual implement.  The importance of the camelid is further underscored by the remains of a textile (most likely made from the hair of the llama's cousin, the alpaca) visible on the knife's right side of the blade.  Now converted into metal, a plainly woven fabric was wrapped around this special knife before its burial. In the ancient Andes, textiles protected and sanctified individuals ([headcloth 11), and obviously works of art as well (see [chancay figure 12]).  Not only a metal homage to fiber, this tumi also epitomizes the Inca spare yet elegant style.       \"\n",

      "Greenstone Tools Become Jewelry\n",
      "Any naturally green stone, preferably hard, was highly valued in ancient Costa Rica. The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\n",
      "Most greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5). This “art-tool” communicated that the wearer wielded power over agriculture, animals, and other humans.\n",
      "Yet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n",

      "Yet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n",

      "Greenstone Tools Become Jewelry\n",
      "Any naturally green stone, preferably hard, was highly valued in ancient Costa Rica. The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\n",
      "Most greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5).

      "In ancient Costa Rica the utilitarian hand-held axe, or \"celt\" (1-3), used to clear land for agriculture, was the inspiration for a series of ceremonial necklaces created in more precious materials. The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine \n",
      "jewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w).\n",
      "\n",
      "What is most fascinating about making necklaces from axes is that the complete celt (4-6) was also subdivided in many ways and those pieces then worn as necklaces (7-17). This complex splitting process shows that the artist was able to make a complete celt and then to break it, despite the hardness of the material, so that the part still reflected its place in the original whole. The agricultural tool shape had to be honored since it was the key to the statement of power over nature made by the wearer. Half celts (7-9) are the front or the back face of a whole celt, made by carving a whole celt in from both sides until the front could be snapped off the back. The bumpy ridge, or septum, was left (9), as evidence of successful snapping. Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"mother\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"children.\"\n",

      "Costa Rica the utilitarian hand-held axe, or \"celt\" (1-3), used to clear land for agriculture, was the inspiration for a series of ceremonial necklaces created in more precious materials. The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine jewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w). What is most fascinating about making necklaces from axes is that the complete celt (4-6) was also subdivided in many ways and those pieces then worn as necklaces (7-17). This complex splitting process shows that the artist was able to make a complete celt and then to break it, despite the hardness of the material, so that the part still reflected its place in the original whole. The agricultural tool shape had to be honored since it was the key to the statement of power over nature made by the wearer. Half celts (7-9) are the front or the back face of a whole celt, made by carving a whole celt in from both sides until the front could be snapped off the back. The bumpy ridge, or septum, was left (9), as evidence of successful snapping. Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"mother\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"children.\" 1-3. Utilitarian Celts.

      "CERAMIC TRADITIONS IN ANCIENT IRAN.  Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n",
      "1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs.  The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC.\n",
      "3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.  Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs.  The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence.\n",
      "5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC.  Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware.  Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.  More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5)\n",
      "11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration.

      "and techniques survived for centuries. The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts. Two types of surface decoration usually were employed. Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls. Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color. Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen. 1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs. The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC. 3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration. Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs. The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence. 5, 8, 10. The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC. Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware. Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles. More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5) 11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration. Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed. 12.

      "Across the world, early artistic statements often include female figurines (1–4) probably because pre-industrial societies rely heavily on women’s fertility for survival. This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. Having enough extra food was rare in ancient Mesoamerica, so body fat represented high status there as well. A protruding stomach and large navel (1), characterizing a woman who has given birth, were also prestigious. This figurine is also noteworthy because her arms move—thread looped through holes in the top of the arms and tied behind her neck hold them in various positions. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary.\n",
      "In western Mexico ca. 200 BC to 300 AD clay effigies were sculpted, such as the seated couple (12, 13) and the dog (11). Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. Couples are common subjects, perhaps images of family to stay with the dead members in the afterlife. In any case, the idea of connection between dead and alive is expressed; the cyclical Amerindian worldview does not entirely distinguish between death and life. Dogs were not only earthly companions, but were fattened and consumed in this area, so clay canines symbolize afterlife sustenance as well. As elsewhere, dogs also were believed to guide souls into the Other Side.\n",
      "Moving eastward, early Guerrero art featured the Mezcala [mehz cah lah] stone carving style (7, 8). Small, finely ground images of structures, complete with staircases and doors, sometimes include prone figures on top (8). This suggests the elevation of the deceased in/on a temple, implying these were models put in the grave to honor the ancestor. Since life and death were interrelated, the deceased influenced affairs of the living, ensuring the rains, fertility, and so on.\n",
      "In early Central Mexico highly skilled ceramicists hand built large and impressive vessels (5, 6, 9, 10) at the site of Chupícuaro [choo peek wahr oh]. Simple tripods refer to the evolution from baskets to clay containers by painting a diagonal pattern around the rim (5), depicting the spiral finishing of baskets’ tops. More elaborate geometric patterns also follow diagonal formats that defer to the constraints of basket weaving (6, 9, 10). Though no actual textiles survive from this region, we can infer the importance of the fiber arts throughout Mesoamerican antiquity.\n",

      "An important trade item in early ancient Mesoamerica was obsidian, or volcanic glass (1-7). It was prized primarily for its razor-sharp edge (it is still employed today in some eye surgery). From weapons such as spear points (1, 2) to cutting tools such as knives (7), obsidian was the material of choice. With great skill, blades (4) could be chiseled off of cores (3, 5, 6), but the process of striking off a blade as thin and translucent as this one, prone to breaking, was difficult to master. The Aztecs mounted such blades along the length of a club for a highly effective weapon. Some obsidian is naturally greenish (1) and was particularly prestigious and rare. \n",

      "\" West Mexican art principally concerns the connections between people, living to living as well as living to dead.  This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth's surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.  Thus, the sculptures safely and symbolically contradicted that isolation by stressing the continued bonds between people in the two realms.  \"\n",

      "When the English poet John Milton called Athens ¿the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts and Eloquence¿ in Paradise Regained (1671), he echoed the opinion of untold generations who had looked on the city as the center of culture and civilization ever since its rise to greatness under the statesman Perikles in the fifth century bc. It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\n",
      "Five years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.\n",

It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years. Five years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.

      "In the ancient Americas animals and humans were considered to exist on a continuum. Thus, many images of animals contain human traits—2 and 4 have human almond-shaped eyes. Another important assumption is that all phenomena relate in a series of analogies, often based on visual or functional similarities.

They are shown upside down, a further indication that they are dead, i.e., in the afterlife, an inverted Underworld.

      "Late Nasca Ceramics  \n",
      "The Nasca thrived on the South Coast between AD 1 and 800, and these pieces date from late in their ceramic tradition. Some late pieces remain typically Nasca, such as a pair of bowls that would have been placed in the grave of a high-status individual (5, 6). It is a measure of high artistic achievement to create two identical pieces, and interest in dualities is characteristic of the Andean worldview. Typical lower-status Nasca bowls (7) evoke baskets, with their telltale diagonal rim patterns. \n",
      "\n",
      "During these late phases many Nasca ceramics show an interest in the patterns of other Central Andean peoples, such as the Wari (1, 2, 4) and the Moche (3). It is not clear whether this openness to new ideas in ceramics was forced  -the Wari were an expansionist state that ultimately  incorporated the Nasca area-or not, since the Moche were on the wane in the North Coast at this time as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even while allowing other styles to influence their own, the Nasca kept their characteristic palette of colors, a bright red, orange, cream, and an unusual gray (1), all surrounded by a strong black outline. But they explored new subject matter, such as a version of the typical Moche running figure (3) or a typically Wari rectilinear monkey motif (1) with the diagnostic Wari foot (white square toenails and a circle for the heel). Vessels such as 2, depicting an unidentifiable animal, have a Wari-like striped band around the rim, and 4 has a repeated circle and cross pattern not found on earlier Nasca vessels. \n",
      "\n",
      "While, in general, creativity implies an openness to new and interesting designs, colors, shapes, and techniques from elsewhere, most traditions explore their particular subject matter to the near exclusion of other people's. Here a strong and vital tradition, perhaps in the process of breaking down after hundreds of years of success, patently explores others' aesthetics. While this may be largely an artistic process meant to reinvigorate a long-established style of ceramic art, it may also indicate a new political reality-that the South Coast was no longer an independent entity.   \n",

      "The Nasca thrived on the South Coast between AD 1 and 800, and these pieces date from late in their ceramic tradition. Some late pieces remain typically Nasca, such as a pair of bowls that would have been placed in the grave of a high-status individual (5, 6). It is a measure of high artistic achievement to create two identical pieces, and interest in dualities is characteristic of the Andean worldview. Typical lower-status Nasca bowls (7) evoke baskets, with their telltale diagonal rim patterns. \n",
      "\n",
      "During these late phases many Nasca ceramics show an interest in the patterns of other Central Andean peoples, such as the Wari (1, 2, 4) and the Moche (3). It is not clear whether this openness to new ideas in ceramics was forced  -the Wari were an expansionist state that ultimately  incorporated the Nasca area-or not, since the Moche were on the wane in the North Coast at this time as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even while allowing other styles to influence their own, the Nasca kept their characteristic palette of colors, a bright red, orange, cream, and an unusual gray (1), all surrounded by a strong black outline. But they explored new subject matter, such as a version of the typical Moche running figure (3) or a typically Wari rectilinear monkey motif (1) with the diagnostic Wari foot (white square toenails and a circle for the heel). Vessels such as 2, depicting an unidentifiable animal, have a Wari-like striped band around the rim, and 4 has a repeated circle and cross pattern not found on earlier Nasca vessels. \n",
      "\n",
      "While, in general, creativity implies an openness to new and interesting designs, colors, shapes, and techniques from elsewhere, most traditions explore their particular subject matter to the near exclusion of other people's. Here a strong and vital tradition, perhaps in the process of breaking down after hundreds of years of success, patently explores others' aesthetics. While this may be largely an artistic process meant to reinvigorate a long-established style of ceramic art, it may also indicate a new political reality-that the South Coast was no longer an independent entity.   \n",

      "and death, suggesting not all such heads correspond to the war realm. (The head/loincloth is repeated on 6.) Other heads jut out from the long animal-headed emanation, an obviously non-terrestrial element that represents the shaman’s animal-self and/or bizarre bodily transformations experienced during trance. Thus, heads also signify the visionary realm—shamans associate visions with the head since all the senses occur there, whereas the body may not be felt at all. Reinforcing that not all heads are fully dead, on the back of the figures in 6 and held by the figure in 5 are heads that feature the pierced lips combined with open (i.e., living) eyes. These eyes feature pupils dangling from the upper lid, a common symbol for feline eyes, which do look like this. Jaguar and puma animal-selves are extremely common in shamanism since a powerful animal-self is most effective for curing illness, defeating lesser shamans, etc. Likewise, 1 features a lower row of feline-eyed heads, their mouths without spines, which are not shown dead in any way except being bodiless. They seem to be vision heads as well, impossibly shown half alive (open eyes) and half dead (spines on mouths); shamans freely traverse the worlds of the living and the dead during their out-of-body trances. The flying shamans in 6 underscore this visionary freedom: their wings and tails end in the head motifs, more and more abstracted down to three dots on the ends of the tail feathers. 1.

      "Interactions between Mesoamerica and Costa Rica\n",
      "“Mesoamerica,” the middle of the continent, typically includes Belize, Guatemala, southern Mexico, and western El Salvador and Honduras. Yet in antiquity the distinction between this area and lower Central America (Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panamá) is not so clear. The two culture areas diverge, exhibiting profound linguistic distinctions, for instance. However, centuries of mutual trade in objects and ideas via the Maya and even periodic migrations of Nahuatl speakers from Central Mexico into northern Costa Rica make the connections seem equally strong. Neighbors with interconnections may characterize the situation best.\n",
      "Direct influence from Mesoamerica southward is clear from the introduction into Costa Rica of foreign subject matter such as the Feathered Serpent (1, 2). The Aztecs’ Quetzalcoatl, a bird-snake spirit of fertility and  transformation, has round eyes, an open mouth, undulating body, and feathers. However, in Costa Rican interpretations the vessel shapes differ from those of Central Mexico, and local painting styles include Papagayo light color washes (1) and Galo shiny surfaces (2).\n",
      "North to south influence also appears in the blending of Maya, Honduran, and Costa Rican features. The cylinder is a Maya form which entered Honduran vocabulary via the trade in salt and cacao. It gained feet (15) and cut-out bases (14) in Honduras, in turn reinterpreted in Costa Rican Galo and Papagayo styles. Maya rim bands of glyphs remain in vestigial form throughout the layers of influences, though they become illegibly abstract.\n",
      "Plain metates, grinding platforms occur earlier in Mesoamerica and resemble (12) (although this one is from Costa Rica). Everyday usage is indicated by the low profile and formal simplicity; however, almost all Costa Rican metates were carved into elaborate, more delicate forms (13). This shows that lower Central American artists often fundamentally changed foreign ideas. Likewise, Mesoamerican functional greenstone items became elaborated Costa Rican ones. The northern hand axe may be made from common stone in a useable size (7) or more precious green stone in miniature (5, 6), but remains plain. In the south, an occasional unadorned example occurs in an interesting spotted stone (3), yet most are converted into pendants and carved into detailed avian (4) or human images.\n",
      "Actual jadeite, the hardest and rarest greenstone, was coveted by artists everywhere. When jade became scarce around 500 AD apparently extreme measures were taken: in Costa Rica imitations of Maya green earspools (10) were created in clay (11). Since the material was too precious to waste, traded Costa Rican axes were split and given holes to be worn as belt celts by the Maya (9). Such recarving could be extensive, as in 8, a pendant that began in Costa Rica as a staffbearing figure, was converted into a harpy eagle over a skull by the Maya, and ultimately returned south. Certainly the tale told by such complex objects reveals the many ways Mesoamerica and Costa Rica were intertwined in antiquity.\n",

      "The ethereal sound of panpipes (3, 4), often accompanied by high-pitched flutes (1, 2, 5–8) and steady drums (9), is synonymous with traditional Andean culture. The music still played today has its roots deep in antiquity— the panpipes or antaras shown here were made nearly two thousand years ago. While modern panpipes are tied together sets of graduated-length, open-ended wood or reed tubes, the ancient ones are made of clay and each opening is closed at the bottom. Thus, the musician blew across the contained columns of air to produce different tones, a difficult feat. The two holes in 3 were for wearing the instrument like a necklace.\n",
      "Flutes, the other main wind instrument, include the Central Andean qena [kay nah] (8) that was played like a recorder, held in a vertical position with the notch upward. Fingering the holes produces five notes; this pentatonic scale is characteristic of all ancient American\n",
      "music (versus the European eight-note scale). This one is made of animal bone, which was burned (pyroengraved) in a decorative pattern of circles. It could also be worn; some cotton string ties remain.\n",
      "In ancient Colombia flutes (1, 2, 5–7) take different forms specifically mimicking shells, likely the first natural wind instruments. The large ones echo the shape of giant snail shells (1, 2), the smaller those of seashells (5–7). x-rays show that not only the exterior look of the shells was achieved but the interior three-dimensional spirals as well, so as to produce the exact acoustics of a real shell. This represents a prodigious artistic accomplishment. This impressive creative process signals a key Amerindian value, namely that images must be true to the subject and so finished on all sides, inside and out. Objects were considered to have their own life force and musical instruments in particular could communicate with the spirit realm in an appropriately invisible form. They could not achieve this if they were incomplete; in this case literally they would not sound right if they were not made like a real shell.\n",
      "Images of animals are also given the capacity of sound as in the bird on the four-chamber vessel (10). A whistling mechanism was built into the handle: air blown into the spout exits from a small hole behind the bird’s head.

Thibadeau. \"For I am the Black Jaguar\" gallery label: Flutes to Call the Spirits Another key instrument in shamanic ritual and art is the flute, which—along with the human voice—creates melodies to complement the percussive rattle and drum. Shamans today play wind instruments to call spirits to heal their clients; sound, air, wind, smoke, all are suitably ethereal modes to communicate with unseen divine realm. Ancient animal-effigy flutes may have functioned to invoke a bat spirit (2) or that of an armadillo (3), or a feline (7). Blowing through the tail blowholes and fingering the four holes on the backs of the bat and armadillo creates beautiful, haunting melodies in a pentatonic (five-note) scale characteristic of the Americas. The artists designed these flutes intentionally so that the animals would be inverted when they were played, embodying how bats cheep when they roost upside down and armadillos burrow underground. Bats are talented nocturnal hunters that seem to magically see in the dark, and armadillos are capable of filling their shells with water and walking along creek beds completely submerged—both make impressive animal spirits to help shamans cure. In the simple Andean bone flute (1) blowing across the notch creates the necessary initial air turbulence, while using fingers to stop each hole produces four notes and stopping none constitutes the fifth. An unusual flute from ancient Veracruz (4) contains a rattle ball; tilting it while playing makes odd sliding sounds as the ball travels up and down. Strange auditory effects are characteristic of both shamanic rituals and visions. Natural models for musical instruments are exemplified in Colombian shell-shaped flutes (5–7). Blowing into an actual shell makes a deep, moving sound, which can be slightly altered by lip tension into more than one note. The x-ray shows that artists painstakingly formed these instruments to spiral inside like real shells, so as to reproduce their exact tonal qualities. Shamans recount that they see inside things during their visions, and that all that seems hidden in the earthly realm is revealed to them (a concept known in the Inka language as ukhu). 1.

      "\"Young men masquerading as spirits make their appearance in village communities during annual dry season festivals and occasionally funerals held by the Igbo peoples in southeastern Nigeria.    Some of these spirits are merely lighthearted entertainers while others are intimidating and frightening.  All of these spirits play a part in enforcing the moral values of the community through masquerade performances.  Masquerade spirits had important authoritative social and political roles in earlier times and occasionally some still do.   These masquerades are created and performed by males initiated into the maiden society, or Mmuo, and serve to perpetuate the community's morals and ideals.   Status within the community is determined by age and social position.  Only certain masquerades are performed by youths while others are reserved for the middle-aged or  for the elders.  The complex tradition of Igbo masking involves a variety of mask types and masquerade dances in every region and their changes over time.   The cities of Onitsha and Awka are especially known for their extremely rich and diverse masking traditions.  Masking involves the creation of particular sights, sounds and smells to produce a desired effect.  For example, fine fabric costumes and masks with idealized hairstyles and features reflect the power of beauty, whereas horns, smelly medicines and animal skins combine to embody the power of threatening spirits.  The variety of masquerade types includes \"\"The Fame of the Maidens\"\", or Ude Agbogho, which celebrates the ideals of beauty and femininity;  Ijele, a popular masking tradition involving a large colorful superstructure; and Mgbedike, where  powerful and forceful spirits appear in bulky costumes and a variety of fearsome masks.    An entourage of chorus singers and escorts usually accompany the spirits.  Mgbedike spirits can be destructive and wild and tend to acquire followers as they move from one village to another.  The maiden masquerade, however, is performed by a group in a central location surrounded by an often massive crowd.  Here a maiden spirit from Ezira in Aguata Local Government Area is seen performing during a Mm?nwu festival in 1988.   The music aides in creating the atmosphere - building up levels of energy, directing the activity of the actors, unfolding the drama, and keeping the audience in thrall.  Maiden masks, or agbogho mmuo, creatively reflect spiritual beauty and moral purity, ideals to be attained by young Igbo women.  The carver incorporates an undulating hairline with small concentric circles; flamboyant, openwork crests; intricate combs; and sometimes the addition of small animals as a means to exaggerate the beauty of a young woman's well-kept coiffure.  Red, yellow, orange, green, blue, black and white pigments augment the decorative openwork so notable in these masks.  Aquiline noses, protruding mouths with well-shaped teeth, horizontal eye slits and elaborate facial tattooing or scarification marks, scars created by cutting the skin, exaggerate upon the Igbo ideals of feminine beauty.  The white face identifies this mask as a spirit. The male performers who wear these masks instruct the carvers to incorporate certain motifs and designs into the crests.  Therefore, considerable variety can be found in these masks even though they are used for the same purpose.  Professional tailors specialize in creating the tight-fitting, vibrantly colored and patterned appliquT costumes worn by the Maiden masqueraders.  Mirrors, highly-colored ribbons and felt or yarn wrappings are added to the costume to increase the glitter of the maidens.    Attached breasts, made of wooden cores, help to define characters.  The colorful composition of appliquTd designs, mirrors, ribbons, feathers, and red and yellow pigments reflect uli and other painted body designs.  Uli is women's art.  Women use these patterns to symbolize various natural and man-made things or ideas.    The sophisticated designs can be found in body paintings, wall paintings, hairstyles and textiles.  As a young girl's body is decorated with uli to enhance her beauty and ready her for marriage, so too the maiden costume mimics the maiden's youth and marriagability. The annual \"\"Fame of the Maidens\"\" masquerade, or Obugulu Mau, occurs annually during dry season festivals as a celebration of femininity and motherhood and as a tribute to the Igbo ancestors.    Masqueraders may also be called upon to perform during celebratory second funerals of prominent people.  This maiden spirit from the Amudo Village in Awka is part of an Ijele troup brought by the in-laws to the funeral of Mazi Julius Nwafor Okpaleke in 1988.  The feminine grace and beauty of the maidens allow them to serve as proper escorts for powerful and highly respected elders to the spirit land.  The masquerade dances reflect the ideal demeanor and status of young unmarried Igbo women in an exaggerated style.  As the pride of their fathers and the source of bride-wealth upon their forthcoming marriages, the ideal beauty of a girl has both physical and moral dimensions. Prior to the performance, young girls of the community prepare, clear, and smooth over the dance ground.  They paint the surrounding trees and sing songs alluding to the spirits' imminent visit.  Most of the community and invited guests from neighboring towns attend the performance.  The orchestra is led by two flutists and a master drummer on a slit-gong, with others playing membrane and pot drums, iron gongs, and reed rattles.  A masquerader dressed as the mother sits by the orchestra and watches the performance given by energetic masqueraders posing as her daughters.  The first dance, a warm-up for the three maidens, is led by the first daughter, known as \"\"Headload\"\" due to the very elaborate mask superstructure worn on her head.  Headload initiates the sequence by standing up and stretching herself coquettishly, with innocence and pride, thus delighting the audience.  She then begins her stately dance.  The second and each successive sequence has a faster rhythmic pace, with a relatively fixed order of patterns by each masker.  Intricacy and speedbuild up, ending near the musicians, often with a circular flourish and a final leap.    The appreciative, noisy audience is caught up by the building musical fever and dancers' virtuosity, breaking out in climatic moments with wild applause.  The finale is a group performance by the maiden masqueraders. They form a ring, dancing in unison with firm, energetic steps and quick turns.  Each dance gains momentum, becoming faster and more frenzied, until dancing and music end abruptly.  With a final flourish, the audience bursts out in loud appreciation, gunshots often splitting the air.    The maiden spirits then retire, honored and exhausted from their sojourn among the living, to reappear at next year's dry season festival.  Communities vary the music and dances, allowing individual performers to add their own complicated and unique dance steps.  \"\n",

Mann conceived the work as “a triptych of fairly long short stories of religious tinge.” However, over a sixteen-year period, he expanded the brief biblical account of Joseph’s life, and that of his father, Jacob, into a complex, four-volume, fifteen-hundred-page narrative. He described this effort as “die Fleischwerdung\n",

      "Winslow Homer (1836-1910), one of the greatest of America's nineteenth-century artists, launched his career in 1857 as a freelance illustrator for popular magazines.  For the most part Homer's illustrations featured imagery with a broad appeal for the audiences of  such publications as Harper's Weekly.  Close examination of the illustrations, however,  reveals the lines of development in his art as a whole.  In the years before the Civil War Homer portrayed scenes crowded with figures and anecdotal details.  His work as a correspondent at the front during the war brought a change not only in subject matter, but also in style.  Scenes of the war came to be more sharply focused, with incidental details trimmed away to give a more dramatic effect.  \n",
      "In the years following the war this clarity was carried over to new subjects.  The simplified, yet sophisticated compositions lent charm and elegance to Homer's depiction of people, particularly women and children, engaged in leisure pursuits in the countryside and at the seashore.   The perils of the sea and the human struggle for survival-subjects which foreshadow Homer's later, greatest paintings-began to appear in the illustrations of the 1870s.  In these years the artist began to concentrate on painting in watercolor and in oil, reworking the motifs of the paintings in his magazine illustrations in order to make his more serious work known to a wider audience.  Finally, in 1875 Homer abandoned the field of illustration altogether to support himself solely by his painting.  \n",

The block was then given to an engraver employed by the publisher, who carved away the bare white parts of the surface with a graver, a small sharpened steel rod.  Cutting across the end grain of the wood made possible finely detailed lines.  The lines drawn by the artist were left in relief, to be printed like type.

      "God Spoke the Earth: Stories of Genesis in Prints and Drawings focuses on the enduring narratives of the book of Genesis and highlights the breadth of Emory’s holdings in this genre. Drawn from the permanent collections of the Carlos Museum,\n",
      "Pitts Theology Library, and MARBL (The Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library), this exhibition includes a variety of artistic approaches to the ancient story of creation, from Albrecht Dürer’s famed 1504 engraving, Adam and Eve (The Fall of Man) to Marc Chagall’s 1960 lithograph, Bible II-Creation.\n",
      "The first book of the Torah and the Old Testament, Genesis recounts the origin and beginning of all things. It introduces the Judeo-Christian understanding of a monotheistic God who created and controls the world, and revolves around the sequential themes of creation, sin, re-creation, and redemption. These themes can be traced through the various stories of Genesis, from Creation through the Fall of Man, the Flood, God’s call and promise to Abraham, and more. \n",
      "The works of art in this exhibition span the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, and offer insight into how artists and communities throughout time depicted Genesis narratives and contemplated God’s relationship with mankind. A leaf from a twelfth-century French Bible, the earliest work in the exhibition, depicts a small scene of the Creation of Adam followed by an image of Adam and Eve eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, both in exquisite hand-painted detail. These pictures are followed by a New Testament image of Christ’s crucifixion, reminding the medieval Christian viewer of God’s ultimate redemptive act for the salvation of mankind. Alternately, several works in the exhibition reveal the political climate of the artist’s surroundings. For example, the inscription on a poignant seventeenth-century German drawing of Jacob’s Ladder may draw a comparison between the Redemption of Mankind and the Peace of Westphalia, which brought an end to the Thirty Years War.\n",
      "The title of the exhibition derives from the Creation Story recounted in the second chapter of Genesis, in which God speaks the creation of Earth and all living things. It denotes the mysterious, creative power of the Judeo-Christian God that has captivated and inspired artists, and offers a testament to the lasting importance of stories of Genesis.\n",

      "This fantastical series of watercolors by Joan Waddell-Barnes was created for an American edition of Thomas Mann’s novel Joseph and His Brothers. Mann conceived the work as “a triptych of fairly long short stories of religious tinge.” However, over a sixteen-year period, he expanded the brief biblical account of Joseph’s life, and that of his father, Jacob, into a complex, four-volume, fifteen-hundred-page narrative. He described this effort as “die Fleischwerdung des Mythos,” the transformation of myth into flesh.\n",
      "To prepare for this imaginative retelling, Mann drew inspiration from a multitude of source materials, including Jewish scriptural exegesis, astrology, comparative mythology, and the history of ancient Egypt. The political climate in Germany leading up to the second World War also influenced Mann’s epic tale. Though of German Protestant heritage, Mann, like many of his compatriots, was deeply affected by Nazi Germany’s genocidal treatment of the Jews. He fled to Switzerland after Hitler’s rise to power, and later, in 1939, emigrated to the United States.\n",
      "In 1942, Mann was introduced to the work of a young Joan Waddell, a student of Mann’s close friend, art historian Wolfgang Born. Born sent Mann two of Waddell’s drawings of Aschenbach, the main character of Mann’s Death in Venice. He was delighted by the drawings, calling them “intellectualized and surrealistic.” It is unclear whether Mann requested Waddell-Barnes to complete this series of illustrations for Joseph and His Brothers, or whether the artist volunteered her services. In any case, correspondence between the two confirms a friendship and both parties’ enthusiasm for the project.\n",
      "Waddell-Barnes’ expressionistic style also bends toward surrealism in these illustrations. For example, in Joseph’s Sojourn in the Well, the artist brings the primeval prototypes of a womb and a dead planet out of Joseph’s mind and into the reality of his surroundings. Likewise, Waddell-Barnes blends the forms of Joseph and his mother, Rachel, in Joseph Tries on the Coat of Many Colours. This stylistic choice was made in response to Jacob’s reaction at beholding Joseph, “It was the mother-goddess who stood there before him smiling, in the boy’s lovely guise….”\n",
      "A selection of twelve out of the series of eighteen illustrations, given to the Carlos Museum by the artist herself, are presented here. They beautifully capture Mann’s Amarna Period setting and what he termed a narrative of “love and hate, blessing and curse, fraternal strife and paternal grief, pride and penance, fall and rise, a humorous song of mankind.” Although Mann and Waddell-Barnes hoped these illustrations would accompany a two-volume edition of Joseph and His Brothers, it was never published.\n",

      "Along the desert coast of Peru various cultures rose and fell in ancient times. The central coast Chancay, the north coast Chimú, and south coast Ica coexisted between around 1000 and 1450 AD. Their ceramic styles and techniques are diverse, with the Chimú specializing in blackware (1, 2), the Chancay buffware (4, 5), and the Ica polychromes (6, 7). Chimú vessels are finely sculpted and skillfully fired in the challenging oxygen-reduced method; however, the use of molds allowed multiple copies. Chancay examples are rather freeform in decoration and hastily executed; however, they can be large (4), which is difficult to accomplish in hand-built, pit-fired ceramics. Ica pieces are more diminutive and carefully painted with textilelike designs. They can also integrate sculptural details, such as tiny figures performing a ritual (7).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Chimú blackwares (1) continue the long north coastal tradition of the double-to-single spout vessel (in use since the Chavín and Moche times). Chimú examples typically add a small element at the joins between spouts and vessel body, here delicately drooping fruits. The female effigy (2) personifies the bumpy spiny oyster shell (Spondylus princeps), a precious red shell responsible for much of the Chimú wealth and power (see the large gold earrings in the case at right).\n",

      "The Chimú [chee-moo] Empire flourished along much of ancient Peru's coastline between ca. AD 900 and 1470, when the Inka overcame it with their own empire. Art was a primary emphasis in the Chimú capital city of Chan Chan [chahn chahn]; archaeologists estimate that over twelve thousand artists lived there at its height. Tribute in the form of works of art poured into Chan Chan and was stored in the royal palaces, which doubled as enormous storehouses covering many acres. The royals and elites had high-walled, intricate residences, while the artists and other commoners lived in crude, small, labyrinthine neighborhoods. \n",

They were also allowed elaborate double-chambered whistling vessels with charming scenes, such as a bird eating a  snake (6) or a man carrying a monkey (5). These pots whistle when you blow into the plain spout and air exits from a  mechanism in the fancy spout. Filling the chambers with varying amounts of water allows different tones and tilting the piece creates sliding effects. Status was also conveyed by owning at least the image of the Spondylus shell (the spiny oyster, whose highly prized orange interior layer was reserved for the elites), as in 4.

      "other, related properties that would appeal to shamanic peoples. Twice a year, during “red tide,” eating small amounts of the oyster causes dizziness and unusual visual effects, like mild visions. Reinforcing this visionary aspect, when alive the spiny oyster’s body includes a series of small, round, bright blue eyes that line the opening between the two shells. They sense light and signal the bivalve to close against predators. Such repeated and bizarrely colored eyes—no human had blue eyes in the ancient Americas—would strike shamanic cultures as representing extraordinary sight, like that of their spiritual leaders (including when they ate the oysters). Here you can see a vessel that naturalistically represents the exterior look of the spiny oyster (4), with its characteristic bumpy surface. The orange to maroon inner lining of the shell was highly prized and carved into earrings (1) and other jewelry throughout the Americas. Most impressive are the giant earspools (2) that depict the arduous diving required to obtain the Spondylus shell, which attaches to rocks as deep as 100 feet in the ocean. Under a large sail and flocks of birds, two backto- back men receive shells from divers below the raft. The great size and precious materials of these earspools indicate they were worn by a very high-ranking person in the Chimú Empire. Indeed, the Spanish chronicles describe an official called the Fonga Sigde who was in charge of the trade in spiny oysters from the north (they occur in the warm waters off the coast of Ecuador and in the Caribbean). It appears likely that such an important and mature man, old enough to have sufficiently stretched earlobes, wore these massive earspools. Chimú artists also commemorated the shell in a female effigy (3), her body covered in two-dimensional rows of spines and her head sprouting three-dimensional ones. A red-lined bivalve from the salty warm sea waters has inherently female fertility connotations. Like other transformational shamanic art, a person can become a shell, an animal, a plant, or any being at all during trance. 1. Spondylus Shell Earspool Mesoamerica Maya Spondylus shell 1994.18.2.

      "Around 800 BC, a new society emerged in Greece that centered around an architecturally defined community (polis). Writing, lost in the preceding Dark Ages, was recovered by contact in the east. The abstract forms that characterize the art of this society have given rise to the term Geometric period.  \n",

      "The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000–1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (1, 2), Minoan (7), and Mycenaean (3–6) civilizations flourished.  The Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000–2000 B.C.) witnessed the flowering of Cycladic culture.  The Cyclades, meaning “those in a circle,” names a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea.  Situated between mainland Greece, Crete, and Anatolia (modern Turkey), these islands played a vital role in the development of Greek civilization through trade and communication with other regions of the Mediterranean as well as through their growth as a distinct island society, fostered by the relative isolation of the sea.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The famous Cycladic “idols,” of which numerous examples survive today, are the most characteristic form of Cycladic art.  The so-called violin figurines (1) represent the earliest type of Cycladic sculpture, dating from the Early Cycladic I period of ca. 3000–2700 B.C.  The other figurine seen here (2) is of the so-called folded-arm type, a style associated with the Early Cycladic II period of ca. 2700–2200 B.C.  Both figurines are highly abstracted interpretations of the female form, the first emphasizing a woman’s reproductive regions and the second focusing on the proportion of the female body.  We know little about the original function of these statuettes, most of which were found in graves or settlements.  Presumably they possessed a spiritual or religious significance; scholars often associate them with burial practice or fertility cults.  \n",

      "Minoan Crete dominated the Aegean Sea from ca. 2000–1450 B.C., with the mainland Mycenaean Greeks acquiring their greatest power in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C.  Bronze or lead votive statuettes (7) are a characteristic product of Minoan Crete:  a male worshipper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration.  In the Late Bronze Age, the Mycenaeans established a trading empire stretching from Syria to Spain.  Distinctive Mycenaean stirrup jars (6), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean.  Although much about Greek Bronze Age culture remains enigmatic to us, we can appreciate many of their achievements, including the invention of early forms of the Greek language, the production of highly sophisticated works of art, and the construction of significant palaces and citadels. \n",

Carlos Collection of Ancient Greek Art. 1988.2 118G - BRONZE AGE AND GEOMETRIC GREECE The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000-1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (1, 2), Minoan (7), and Mycenaean (3-6) civilizations flourished. The Early Bronze Age (ca. 3000-2000 B.C.) witnessed the flowering of Cycladic culture. The Cyclades, meaning \"those in a circle,\" names a group of small islands in the center of the Aegean Sea. Situated between mainland Greece, Crete, and Anatolia (modern Turkey), these islands played a vital role in the development of Greek civilization through trade and communication with other regions of the Mediterranean as well as through their growth as a distinct island society, fostered by the relative isolation of the sea. The famous Cycladic \"idols,\" of which numerous examples survive today, are the most characteristic form of Cycladic art. The so-called violin figurines (1) represent the earliest type of Cycladic sculpture, dating from the Early Cycladic I period of ca. 3000-2700 B.C. The other figurine seen here (2) is of the so-called folded-arm type, a style associated with the Early Cycladic II period of ca. 2700Ð2200 B.C. Both figurines are highly abstracted interpretations of the female form, the first emphasizing a woman's reproductive regions and the second focusing on the proportion of the female body.\n",

      "¿A picture is more like the real world when it is made from the real world.¿\n",
      "--Robert Rauschenberg (American, born Port Arthur, Texas, 1925)\n",
      "\n",
      "Robert Rauschenberg once said that he worked in ¿the gap¿ between art and life.  One way in which he straddles these two realms is by physically incorporating into his work everyday objects-more often than not things he has found discarded in the street.  In the 1950s Rauschenberg created a series of works called Combines, because they mixed elements of both painting and sculpture, by attaching three-dimensional objects that might be as mundane as an old sock or as startling as a stuffed angora goat to canvas or wooden supports.   Later, working in two dimensions, the artist began to insert the real world into his work by transferring photographs and headlines from newspapers and popular magazines directly onto paper by rubbing them with solvent.  Beginning in 1962, when he was introduced to the technique by Andy Warhol, Rauschenberg began to reproduce these fragments of publications onto paper and canvas via the technique of silkscreen or screen printing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the 1960s Rauschenberg's work manifested an interest in politics and contemporary events, but as the decade wore on his attitude changed from one of  buoyant optimism to a growing unease that culminated in the series of prints shown here,  Surface Series (from Currents) and Features (from Currents).  Daily newspapers from major cities across the United States were the ¿real-world¿ materials that he used to make these works.  In January and February of 1970 he clipped headlines, articles, photographs, and advertisements from the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the Minneapolis Tribune, the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Once he had selected the texts and images, Rauschenberg assembled the cuttings into thirty-six collages, titled Currents.

      "AFTER:----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "real world when it is made from the real world.¿ --Robert Rauschenberg (American, born Port Arthur, Texas, 1925) Robert Rauschenberg once said that he worked in ¿the gap¿ between art and life. One way in which he straddles these two realms is by physically incorporating into his work everyday objects-more often than not things he has found discarded in the street. In the 1950s Rauschenberg created a series of works called Combines, because they mixed elements of both painting and sculpture, by attaching three-dimensional objects that might be as mundane as an old sock or as startling as a stuffed angora goat to canvas or wooden supports. Later, working in two dimensions, the artist began to insert the real world into his work by transferring photographs and headlines from newspapers and popular magazines directly onto paper by rubbing them with solvent. Beginning in 1962, when he was introduced to the technique by Andy Warhol, Rauschenberg began to reproduce these fragments of publications onto paper and canvas via the technique of silkscreen or screen printing. Throughout the 1960s Rauschenberg's work manifested an interest in politics and contemporary events, but as the decade wore on his attitude changed from one of buoyant optimism to a growing unease that culminated in the series of prints shown here, Surface Series (from Currents) and Features (from Currents). Daily newspapers from major cities across the United States were the ¿real-world¿ materials that he used to make these works. In January and February of 1970 he clipped headlines, articles, photographs, and advertisements from the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the Minneapolis Tribune, the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Once he had selected the texts and images, Rauschenberg assembled the cuttings into thirty-six collages, titled Currents. These collages were then photographed to produce screens for one colossal print and the two portfolios shown in this exhibition. In these portfolios, Rauschenberg capitalized on the flexibility of the technique by using individual screens multiple times. This recycling of imagery is most striking in Surface Series where the layering of three screens in a single impression results in a dense and indistinct image. Rauschenberg characterized these prints as ¿the most serious journalism I had ever attempted.¿ The two series, composed from the ephemeral medium of newspapers, form what is essentially a permanent scrapbook to convey his message about the deteriorating state of a world threatened by environmental hazards, racial violence, strife in the Middle East, and an unpopular war in Southeast Asia.

Myth served as a means for understanding one's history, social structures, and place in the world.  Closely connected to religion, it played an integral role in many facets of daily life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Greek mythology grew out of the religious traditions and cultural memories of the Bronze Age.  Far from being fixed, Greek myths were subject to endless variations.  The leading gods and heroes, however, emerge fairly early on.  The pantheon was headed by the deities who occupied Mount Olympos and thus were known as the Olympians.  They included the father of the gods, Zeus, as well as Athena, goddess of wisdom, arts and industry (2), Aphrodite, goddess of love (3, 4), Hermes, messenger of the gods (7), and Artemis, goddess of the hunt (5). These were joined by a host of lesser deities as well as the famous heroes, who were children of one divine parent, including Herakles, Theseus, and Helen.  Some legends of heroes, such as the Trojan War, were not entirely fictitious, and some historical figures, such as Alexander the Great, could even become mythologized into legendary heroes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The flexibility of Greek myth and the close association of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman religion allowed the Romans to adopt and assimilate many aspects of Greek mythology into their own religious framework.  Roman gods, goddesses, and heroes take on many of the same attributes and qualities of their Greek counterparts, although they have different names.  Aphrodite becomes Venus; Hermes becomes Mercury; Zeus becomes Jupiter; Hera becomes Juno, and Athena becomes Minerva.  The objects in this case are Roman in date but are based upon the traditions of Greek art and mythology. \n",

Over the next two centuries, Greek cities on the mainland, islands, and coast of Asia Minor founded colonial settlements throughout the Mediterranean.

The breath-taking ambition and scale of this undertaking is illustrated by the nearby map.\n",

The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan.\n",
      "1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired.  The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving.  Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2).  This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan.\n",
      "304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter's wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes.  Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. \n",
      "5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean.  ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters.  Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware  Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline.\n",
      "8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age.  Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles.  These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles.\n",
      "10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age.  Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris.  Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin.  Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant.\n",
      "18.  This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age.  The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes.  Used as cult objects, these figurines were a schematic representation of a female deity and throne and reflect a Mycenaean religious heritage that was preserved by the Philistines.\n",
      "14-15.  These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan.  At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture.  Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire.  Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period.  A large proportion of the pottery (17) was simply painted in a fashion local to the region and northern Arabia.\n",
      "21. During the 7th century BC a system of marked and plain dome-shaped weights came into use in the Levant.  The different sized weights were based on the shekel, averaging 11.4 grams, and were used for weighing payment in the form of silver ingots for trade transactions.\n",

      "Jericho During the Proto-Urban-Early Bronze Age (ca 3300-2300 BC) Jericho's last major settlement of the Neolithic period (8500-4300 BC) was abandoned during the fifth millennium BC.  The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site.  Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.  Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain.\n",
      "The population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions.  Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy.\n",
      "Graves and burial offering provide most of our information about Jericho during the period.  Several generations of extended families or members of certain social groups used the same graves over long periods of time.  Burial chambers were hewn out of the stone faces of riverbeds, northeast of the city mound, and were generally used for multiple burials.  Pottery, jewelry and weapons were the most common goods deposited with the dead.\n",
      "Jericho's Early Bronze Age town flourished until the second half of the third millennium B.C. Along with other towns and cities in the Levant, Jericho was destroyed and temporarily abandoned.  The disruptions of the time may have been the result of drought, erosion, and deforestation as well as internal conflicts among the Levantine towns and cities.  Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho.\n",
      "1-4. Pottery, with its different shapes and decoration, is our primary source for understanding the cultural origins, foreign influences, and international connections for the people of Jericho.  These vessels represent one of the three pottery traditions at the site during the Proto-Urban period.  Called Proto-Urban A, this tradition consisted of handmade bowls and jugs that were covered with a burnished or polished red slip.  Parallels with similar pottery traditions in the Near East suggest the influence of people from Syria and Anatolia.\n",
      "5-8. Jewelry was a common offering in graves of men and women during the Proto-Urban period.  Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia.\n",
      "9. Although the period is called Early Bronze Age, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was virtually non-existent at Jericho.  Copper was sometimes used for certain tools and weapons including daggers or axeheads, but these objects were rarely deposited in tombs.  When the copper or bronze objects do appear in tombs, they are usually in the form of highly prized jewelry, rings, bracelets and beads.\n",
      "10-12. Animal bones with holes partially drilled into one end were deposited as offerings in some of the Early Bronze Age graves.  Though called by various names, including ¿idols¿, ¿dolls¿, or ¿cult objects¿, their function remains a mystery.\n",
      "13-24.  Pottery from the Early Bronze Age was essentially handmade, though parts of vessels were made on a simple potter's wheel.  Vessels were usually covered with a burnished red slip.  Shapes of the period included storage jars, cooking pots, deep kraters (mixing vessels for wine), jugs, juglets (16-22) and amphoriskoi (perfume or oil bottles).  Little juglets and amphoriskoi were used to store precious oils and small flat bowls (23) served as oil lamps.\n",

      "Maya Polychrome Ceramics\n",
      "During their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts. Class consciousness can also be discerned in vessels that imitate high status examples (3).\n",
      "The subjects may be expressively human, such as a gentle and genteel Maya mother with a child on her back (6, the baby’s head has broken off). They may relate to rulers, adding a profile face found on royal headdresses and scepters (5) to a container for drinking the high-status chocolate beverage kakaw. Further up the scale, some vessels concern deities: 2 represents the snakefooted god K’awil, patron of divination and rulership. Highly esoteric images include disembodied eyeballs interspersed with jaguar spots (4), perhaps a reference to the addition of entheogens to the kakaw and the dizzying visions of becoming a jaguar that result.\n",
      "Some pieces speak to issues we may not associate with preindustrial societies, including “art for art’s sake.” While most Maya ceramics depict recognizable imagery, 1’s subject is limited to the brushstroke itself, seemingly an instance of art about art. The elevated social status of the artist, usually just below royalty, apparently meant that at times aesthetics could be self-referential.\n",
      "The social status hierarchy is also apparent in 3: while many chocolate vessels have hieroglyphs painted around the rim identifying the scene and/or the pot’s owner, here the generalized shapes in this position are actually only pretend writing. These “pseudo-glyphs” indicate that the owner had an artist, who presumably could not read glyphs either, come up with gibberish to impress others. A highly elaborated culture generates fine social distinctions, and rule breaking as well as following them.\n",

Arnett 2006 label for permanent collection gallery: Maya Shell, Clay & Stone The Maya worked in Spondylus shell (1), clay (8-12), and stone, including jadeite and its close relatives (2-7). These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey. Spondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean. This type of open-centered earspool is typical of the Maya (4, 7) and represents a flower. The earspool would have been held in place by a central bead strung on a string that went through the hole in the earlobe, with more beads behind the earlobe serving as a counterweight. Maya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9, 10) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 11, 12). Like the painted pieces, a calligraphic line governs the fine incisions on 9 and 10, and delicate features are sculpted on the figurines. The latter are actually musical instruments: the mother and child (8) is a whistle, and the two standing females are rattles (11, 12). Green stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Even their teeth were inlaid with dots of green (3). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. The pendant is a particularly fine piece, combining a harpy eagle with a human skull. This piece was actually found in Costa Rica, reflecting the practice of trading (or perhaps stealing) jades and recarving them. 1. Spondylus Shell Earspool. Mesoamerica, Maya.

      "\n",
      "During Neolithic times, known to Egyptologists as the Predynastic Period, Egypt was not yet united under a single king. There were, however, many settlements in existence along the Nile valley. Most of these are known today less from their living sites than from their cemeteries that were situated in the Upper Egyptian desert and are thus easily accessible to archaeologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead were buried in a contracted position in shallow pits dug in the sand and were surrounded by grave goods consisting of pots, which probably contained food and drink, and personal items like cosmetic palettes. These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n",
      "\n",
      "The preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n",
      "\t\n",
      "Slate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period. They were used for grinding various ores, such as galena (lead sulphide) or malachite (copper carbonate) in order to produce eye make-up, which was worn by both men and women. \n",
      "\t\n",
      "Finely finished pottery in red and black was characteristic of the Upper Egyptian predynastic and formed part of an African ceramic tradition that continues through the present day. \n",

Even in the earliest phases of the Pre-dynastic Period, the artistic refinement notable in Egyptian art is evident in finely crafted flint and stone tools and ceramic vessels used in daily life or as offerings in tombs. The earliest pottery of the Predynastic Period was fired in simple kilns without control over the firing atmosphere. Areas of the iron-rich clay that were exposed to oxygen fired red, while those that were not, turned black. Eventually, by controlling the firing, pots in all red, all black, or the black-topped style could be produced. White pigment could be used to decorate these vessels as well. Later, in the Naqada II, or Gerzean Period vessels were sometimes decorated with designs in red paint either imitating stone vessels or depicting ritualistic funerary scenes in which a boat brings the deceased for burial.\n",

      "An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran, bearing witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition that existed after the mid-third millennium BC. Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular supported flourishing metalworking industries: the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran. Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horse trappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature that displayed distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the lost wax technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by means of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horse breeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle, and horses.\n",

      "The Art of Metalwork in Ancient Iran.  An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC.  Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran.  Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery.  The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch.  The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders.  The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses.\n",
      "1-4. The rich tombs in the Gilan province of northern Iran have revealed large quantities of metalwork ranging from gold and silver bowls and beakers to bronze figurines of animals and weapons.  Daggers and spearheads of different shapes and sizes were extremely numerous and were left exclusively in graves belonging to men.  Unlike those at Luristan, bronze weapons lacked elaborate decoration and reflects an isolate, artistic tradition.\n",
      "8-15. The metalworkers of Luristan produced a wide variety of bronze objects which incorporated the stunning imagery of native animals and mythical beasts.  Animal forms ranged in style from natural to abstract and were generally cast or hammered into shape as zoomorphic handles or projections on weapons and tools.\n",
      "8. Since bronze required continual sharpening to maintain a useful edge, whetstones were an important piece of equipment used to hone the edges of daggers, swords, spears, arrows and axes.  Whetstone handles were often cast into zoomorphic representations or animals.  The ibex was the most popular choice, perhaps because of its most striking attribute - its sweeping curved horns.  In almost all cases, these were curved into a convenient loop from which the whetstone was suspended.\n",
      "10.  The importance of the horse in ancient Luristan is documented by the large number of surviving horse trappings and decorative harness fittings.  Cheekpieces, like this example, were attached to the harness bit and were often cast in a variety of forms ranging from horses, mouflons, and boars to mythical sphinxes, griffins, and master-of-animals.  Representations of figured cheekpieces appear on sculptured reliefs from Assyria, dating to the late eighth and seventh centruries BC, and indicate that these e fittings had a market outside of Luristan.\n",
      "11. At the turn of the first millennium BC, metalworkers often produced bi-metallic tools and weapons with blades made of iron and decorative elements cast in bronze.  This sword hilt's decorative elements consist of a circular pommel decorated with two bearded human and lion head and two crouching lions which form the dagger guard.  Nearly ninety iron examples of this sword type have been found and their complicated, unique, and nearly identical manufacture suggests a close association between the workshops in Luristan.12-14. Standard finials are the hallmark object of Luristan art and its bronze industry between the tenth and seventh centuries BC.  These objects were mounted on bottle-shaped supports by means of a central tube or pin and are meant to be seen from both sides.  Their iconography is striking, varying from rampant goats (12) and lions to the exotic master- or mistress-of-animals (13, 14) representations where abstract human-like bodies are fused with stylize lions, goats, birds, and mythical, fantastic beasts.  Only a few standard finials have been recovered from excavated tombs and sanctuaries and are best interpreted as representations of local gods, deities, or demons.\n",

The Nubian kings of Dynasty 25 (653-586 BC) adopted many Egyptian burial customs including the building of pyramids and the use of shabtis in tombs. In the tomb of Taharqa, more than a thousand shabtis were found, placed there to perform hard labor for the king in the afterlife. The Nubians also brought in various Egyptian gods into their pantheon. Their chief deity was the god Amun. The amulet located in this case depicts the god in his human form. Large amulets, such as these, might have been worn by Nubian royalty. The rulers of the 25th dynasty also sought to keep control of Upper Egypt, with its political center of Thebes, while they ruled from Lower Egypt at Memphis. The earlier role of Divine Adoratrice of Amun was re-established in the Theban area and a celibate woman from the royal house, usually the daughter of the king, held this title. Each Divine Adoratrice was ¿adopted¿ by the previous, ensuring the political continuity of the dynasty. 1, 2. Shabtis of Taharqa. Sudan, Nuri, Pyramid 1. Dynasty 25, reign of Taharqa, ca. 690-664 BC.

They retained these same associations—with supreme royal authority and the cult of the sun—when they were relocated, but now the supreme authority had passed to the emperors of Rome. Sometime after the sixth century both obelisks fell and were buried under mud in the frequently flooded Circus. From their study of classical sources, antiquarians in the Renaissance knew that the two obelisks should still be at the site. Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590), hearing about this just after he had had the Vatican Obelisk moved to the front of St. Peter’s, ordered the obelisks to be excavated. It took nine months and three hundred men to uncover and move the huge stones of the obelisk of Constantius to the piazza where it was reassembled and raised. In an elaborate ceremony in 1588 it was rededicated to “the most invincible Cross.” Little is known about the engraver Brambilla’s life. A native of Milan, he had arrived in Rome by 1575, when he was working there as a printmaker and painter. Some of his most popular works were views of ancient and modern Rome. Van Aelst worked in Rome as a printmaker, print dealer, and publisher. In 1588 he was granted a papal privilege to issue prints of monuments built or restored by Sixtus V. Three of these prints depicted reerected obelisks. Prints identical to this one but without Brambilla’s name exist, perhaps because the work’s popularity necessitated the copying of the image onto a new plate. Giovanni Ambrogio Brambilla (Italian, active 1575-1599), engraver Nicolaus van Aelst (Netherlandish, active in Rome ca. 1585-1613), publisher The Obelisk at San Giovanni Laterano 1589 Engraving The journey of this obelisk from Egypt to the piazza of the Lateran spanned a period of three thousand years. It was originally quarried by Thutmose III ca. 1450 BC and stood at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. When the emperor Augustus (27 BC-14 AD) had the first obelisks brought from Egypt to Rome in 10 BC, he had considered this one, but was deterred by its massive size (over 32 meters tall and weighing 455 tons). The obelisk remained at Karnak until Constantine the Great (306-337 AD), intending to send it to Constantinople, had it transported down the Nile to Alexandria. It went no further, however, until his son Constantius II (337-361) brought it to Rome in 357 and had it erected on the central barrier of the Circus Maximus, forming a pair with one of the obelisks brought earlier by Augustus. In Egypt obelisks were always dedicated by the pharaoh to the sun god.

      "As early as the third millennium BC, a web of interlinked trade-routes existed connecting the Mediterranean basin with Mesopotamia, India, and China. Their significance, only glimpsed in the archaeological record, is better considered in conjunction with the emergence of a common family of languages known as Proto-Indo- European. This is thought to have originated around 4000 BC from a southwards migration from the Pontic Steppes that flowed eastward toward central Asia andwestwards towards Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The archaeological record shows, at the simplest level, a circulation or trade in objects. Thus, for example, etched carnelian beads (1) created in the Indus Valley have been found as far west as the Greek island of Aegina. Nearly a thousand years later, a Mycenean chalice (2) made in Greece traveled to the Levant by way of trade, exchange, or gift. Ultimately, it was consigned to a grave. Similarly, a Mycenean storage jar (3) made its way to Cyprus.\n",

      "More interesting, however, are cases where motifs or elements - ideas - are incorporated by one culture from another. The gold sequin (4) was made in Crete in the form of a papyrus spray, a plant native not to Crete but to Egypt, whose culture undoubtedly inspired it. Egyptian too is the tradition of carving vessels from hardstones, adopted on Crete (6). Of the two jugs modeled in the form of a duck, the Cypriot types (7) were the inspiration for the Mycenean series (8), some of which are legless.\n",

The 11 surviving fragments were carefully cleaned to remove accumulated dirt and grime. Each fragment was gently vacuumed using a low suction High Efficiency Particulate (HEPA) filter vacuum. After confirming the dyes were not water-sensitive, the fragments were repeatedly bathed to remove acidic dirt and deterioration products. A surfactant (anionic detergent) was added to the bath water to help lift dirt off of the fibers and into the water to be washed away. Removing the embedded dirt improved the overall appearance, considerably brightening white threads and lightening dark stains. With repeated rinsing, the textile returned to a more neutral pH, which will promote its long-term preservation. \n",

      "The principle of ayni—reciprocity, dualism, interlockedness— is consummately expressed in cloth such as this, a doublecloth dating to ca. 1000–1470 AD. Its patterns play out in indigo and white, a dualistic color choice, and in the plain-weave technique in which the horizontal warps and vertical wefts are equal partners. Moreover, in doublecloth there are actually two woven cloths, united as one; weavers sit on either side of a loom and create separate fabrics, except when they exchange one color of thread for the other to form the pattern of herders and llamas. In other words, blue areas on this face are white on the other face; likewise, white llamas are blue on the other side. This is a perfect expression of ayni, being the same pattern but in reversed colors.\n",

Humans can only survive in the high altitude, dry climes of the Andes with the help of the hearty llamas and wooly alpacas. People depend on their abundant fur to make clothing to defy the cold night temperatures, meat for protein, dung for fuel, and sinews for ties, among other things.

      "cleaning project, called Ancient Laundry (http://carlos.emory.edu/conservation/case-studies/ancient-american/ancient-laundry-podcast). After bathing, the fragments were dried under clean cloths, which helped to draw more staining out of the textiles through contact and evaporation. The cleaned fragments were then realigned according the their shapes and patterns, suggesting the overall object dimension. Patricia Ewer then stitched the fragments and secured the frayed edges to a pair of padded, wrapped aluminum panels which will serve as display mounts and permanent storage supports. She worked with curator Dr. Rebecca Stone to select a section of the object that would be rolled back over a padded form to reveal the reverse color pattern on the other side of the doublecloth. The principle of ayni—reciprocity, dualism, interlockedness— is consummately expressed in cloth such as this, a doublecloth dating to ca. 1000–1470 AD. Its patterns play out in indigo and white, a dualistic color choice, and in the plain-weave technique in which the horizontal warps and vertical wefts are equal partners. Moreover, in doublecloth there are actually two woven cloths, united as one; weavers sit on either side of a loom and create separate fabrics, except when they exchange one color of thread for the other to form the pattern of herders and llamas. In other words, blue areas on this face are white on the other face; likewise, white llamas are blue on the other side. This is a perfect expression of ayni, being the same pattern but in reversed colors. Further, the interdependence of humans and camels is true ayni. The llama is the large, domesticated New World camel, one of the ancestors of the Old World camels and dromedaries. Humans can only survive in the high altitude, dry climes of the Andes with the help of the hearty llamas and wooly alpacas. People depend on their abundant fur to make clothing to defy the cold night temperatures, meat for protein, dung for fuel, and sinews for ties, among other things. This piece shows herders with llamas on lead lines, bringing them from one pasture to another since time immemorial.

      "In addition to images of the Ramayana, the Carlos Museum is also building a collection of Indian miniature paintings that depict the ten avatars of Vishnu.  The word avatar comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “descent” and refers to when a deity manifests in an earthly embodiment.  In this scene, the demon king Bali had conquered the gods, driving out Indra, king of the god’s heaven.  To vanquish Bali, the god Vishnu descended to earth as Vamana, the fifth avatar depicted as a dwarf-like Brahmin religious student.  To honor the Brahmin student, Bali asked him what he would like as a gift, and Vamana requested, “only as much land as his short legs could cover in three steps.”  However, as Bali completed the request, Vamana grew to an enormous size, transforming into the giant Trivikrama (“Conqueror of the Three Worlds”) and took three steps.  With the first two steps he encompassed the earth, the middle world, and the heavens, returning them to Indra’s rule.  There being nothing left to claim with his final step, Bali, finally recognizing that he was dealing with Vishnu, offered his own head.  Trivikrama then used the pressure of his foot to send Bali to the netherworld.\n",

      "Full text of a 2013 interview with prior owner, Peter Kraus taken from http://eidolonhouse.com/chronicles/2013/12/7/profile-of-a-rare-book-dealer-peter-kraus\n",
      "Q:  Tell me about yourself, even a brief history about how you became a rare book dealer.\n",
      "A:  I was born in England.  My father was a surgeon, and I would have been the fifth generation of medical men had I become a doctor.  I went to Epsom College, a school for the sons of doctors, but while there came under the spell of my uncle, the bookseller, H. P. Kraus.  On leaving school I went to work for him on the day after my eighteenth birthday, and stayed for nine years.  Among the books that were in stock at one time or another while I was there were a Guttenberg Bible, a folio Audubon, and all four Shakespeare folios at the same time.  in 1972 I left to start Ursus Books, named by my friend, the artist and book maker, Leaonard Baskin.  Based on what I had learnt at H. P. Kraus, I dealt in scholarly art books and rare books of all kinds.  After our children were born, my wife, a librarian by profession, started Ursus Prints, dealing in rare decorative prints, and it has been part of Ursus ever since. \n",
      "For the past two years my shop is on the third floor of 699 Madison Avenue.  The building was designed after World War I to be the New York branch of Fortnum and Mason, and is a miniature version of the Picadilly store.  The Depression intervened and the store never materialized.  Prior to that I was in the Carlyle Hotel for 28 years, but the change in the nature of the book trade made those rather large premises unaffordable.  They are now occupied by a major art dealer. \n",
      "I am married with two daughters.  The eldest, Nicola, is the author of The Nanny Diaries, and eight other books, and the younger, Olivia is a lawyer, who has decided to give up law, and came to work in the book shop in August.  I am not a book collector, although I have a large reading library, which is largely non-fiction, consisting mainly of history, biography and travel.  I do, however, very much love and collect Indian miniatures.  I am also a lover of opera, attend the theatre regularly, and surprise am an avid reader, alternating fiction and non-fiction.  I also love to travel, but am never happier than when I return to New York, the greatest city on earth.\n",
      "Q:  What is the preferred genre you deal in?\n",
      "A:  I much prefer illustrated books, whatever the field, but can always be temped by a great, or special book in any field, although I find myself becoming less and less interested in literature.\n",
      "Q:  What is the price range of the books do you deal in?\n",
      "A:  I try to start at $500 and go up from there.  At the moment my most expensive book is $500,000.\n",
      "Q:  What is the most interesting book you've sold?\n",
      "A:  The most interesting book I have ever sold is probably a spectacular early nineteenth century manuscript from the Russian sect of Old Believers.  The illustrations throughout we're quite extraordinary, and because the sect was ruthlessly persecuted, very little of their printed or manuscript work survives. \n",
      "Q:  What was your most unexpected or surprising rare book find?\n",
      "A:  One of my more surprising finds came several years ago in the private office of a French colleague who tends to specialize in books printed before 1900.  He produced a copy of the legendary work by Sonia Delaunay.  La Prose du Transsiberien.  This copy had never been assembled, and the sheets and the vellum binding, which had been hand painted by Delaunay herself, were still flat, and in pristine condition.  This made it one of the most desirable copies of one of the most sought-after books of the twentieth century.  It is now in a private collection in America. \n",
      "Q:  Why do you think books are important in our time of digital media?\n",
      "A:  Books are more important now than ever.  They are the physical manifestations of everything which makes up our civilization.  Of course, information is available digitally, but the physical book is about so much more than information.  Just as talking to a loved one on the phone or by Skype cannot be compared to being in their presence, so the physical book cannot be compared to its digital equivalent. \n",
      "Q:  What has been the biggest challenge you have experienced in rare book dealing?\n",
      "A:  The biggest challenge has been the internet.  Prior to that, knowledge, quality of stock, professionalism, and location, were the things which made the difference.  All that changed overnight.  Now everyone is an expert, ignorance is bliss, and to a degree, anarchy reigns.  Survival for me, and not just my position in the trade, now depends on the four things listed above.  But the internet means that the advantages I would have had just from being in the trade for 50 years have been erased. \n",
      "Q:  What is your proudest moment of rare book dealing?\n",
      "A:  My proudest moment as a rare book dealer was when my uncle, not one to praise anyone lightly, told me that he was proud of me, about ten years after I had left him to start my own business.  There was certainly never anyone else whose opinion I valued more.\n",
      "Q:  What is the best advice you've been given?\n",
      "A:  I was lucky enough to receive tremendous amounts of advice, and help from my elders and betters.  Dealers such as my uncle, Otto Ranschburg, Jake Zeitlin, and Pierre Beres to name just a few, and I think the one piece of advice which they all gave me, was to always try and buy the finest copies.  Always try and go for the best.  And I would still give that advice to anyone dealing or collecting today.\n",

Just as talking to a loved one on the phone or by Skype cannot be compared to being in their presence, so the physical book cannot be compared to its digital equivalent. \n",
      "Q:  What has been the biggest challenge you have experienced in rare book dealing?\n",
      "A:  The biggest challenge has been the internet.  Prior to that, knowledge, quality of stock, professionalism, and location, were the things which made the difference.  All that changed overnight.  Now everyone is an expert, ignorance is bliss, and to a degree, anarchy reigns.  Survival for me, and not just my position in the trade, now depends on the four things listed above.  But the internet means that the advantages I would have had just from being in the trade for 50 years have been erased. \n",
      "Q:  What is your proudest moment of rare book dealing?\n",
      "A:  My proudest moment as a rare book dealer was when my uncle, not one to praise anyone lightly, told me that he was proud of me, about ten years after I had left him to start my own business.  There was certainly never anyone else whose opinion I valued more.\n",
      "Q:  What is the best advice you've been given?\n",
      "A:  I was lucky enough to receive tremendous amounts of advice, and help from my elders and betters.  Dealers such as my uncle, Otto Ranschburg, Jake Zeitlin, and Pierre Beres to name just a few, and I think the one piece of advice which they all gave me, was to always try and buy the finest copies.  Always try and go for the best.  And I would still give that advice to anyone dealing or collecting today.\n",
      "AFTER:----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "yourself, even a brief history about how you became a rare book dealer. A: I was born in England. My father was a surgeon, and I would have been the fifth generation of medical men had I become a doctor. I went to Epsom College, a school for the sons of doctors, but while there came under the spell of my uncle, the bookseller, H. P. Kraus. On leaving school I went to work for him on the day after my eighteenth birthday, and stayed for nine years. Among the books that were in stock at one time or another while I was there were a Guttenberg Bible, a folio Audubon, and all four Shakespeare folios at the same time. in 1972 I left to start Ursus Books, named by my friend, the artist and book maker, Leaonard Baskin. Based on what I had learnt at H. P. Kraus, I dealt in scholarly art books and rare books of all kinds. After our children were born, my wife, a librarian by profession, started Ursus Prints, dealing in rare decorative prints, and it has been part of Ursus ever since. For the past two years my shop is on the third floor of 699 Madison Avenue. The building was designed after World War I to be the New York branch of Fortnum and Mason, and is a miniature version of the Picadilly store. The Depression intervened and the store never materialized. Prior to that I was in the Carlyle Hotel for 28 years, but the change in the nature of the book trade made those rather large premises unaffordable. They are now occupied by a major art dealer. I am married with two daughters. The eldest, Nicola, is the author of The Nanny Diaries, and eight other books, and the younger, Olivia is a lawyer, who has decided to give up law, and came to work in the book shop in August. I am not a book collector, although I have a large reading library, which is largely non-fiction, consisting mainly of history, biography and travel. I do, however, very much love and collect Indian miniatures. I am also a lover of opera, attend the theatre regularly, and surprise am an avid reader, alternating fiction and non-fiction. I also love to travel, but am never happier than when I return to New York, the greatest city on earth. Q: What is the preferred genre you deal in? A: I much prefer illustrated books, whatever the field, but can always be temped by a great, or special book in any field, although I find myself becoming less and less interested in literature. Q: What is the price range of the books do you deal in? A: I try to start at $500 and go up from there. At the moment my most expensive book is $500,000. Q: What is the most interesting book you've sold? A: The most interesting book I have ever sold is probably a spectacular early nineteenth century manuscript from the Russian sect of Old Believers.

      "Before the European invasions in the 16th century, indigenous Americans did not use money. Even after Spanish colonization, coinage remained a somewhat foreign concept imposed by the new overlords. Metal had long functioned as a high-prestige medium but without a set monetary value; textiles played this role instead. However, precious metal discs were often sewn onto garments in ancient times, a tradition that continues today. This ch’uspa (coca bag) from the Candelaria community in Bolivia, created for important occasions, is adorned with Bolivian peso coins minted in the 1970s and 1980s. They are suspended from the bottom, acting as a fringe.\n",
      "These coins, repurposed and effectively rendered useless as a unit of currency, add an additional layer of status to this type of bag. They likely represented a high level of wealth; the man bearing this bag had the resources to use coins as symbols rather than a means of obtaining necessary items. The sounds made by the coins when the wearer moved may also have played a role in the regional dances performed at various festivals and exhibitions of traditional culture in major cities such as La Paz.\n",

Shelley travelled to Bolivia with MCCM funds to purchase textiles for the upcoming Threads of Time exhibition. The funds came from the deaccession of textiles from the Bright Collection of Guatemalan textiles.  When the seven textiles arrived at the MCCM, it was believed that all seven had been purchased with the deaccession funds, so the pieces were numbered 2016.021.001-.007.  Several weeks after the pieces were accessioned, curator Rebecca Bailey mentioned that two of the pieces (at that time numbered 2016.021.002-.003) had actually been purchased by Shelley from a weaver as payment for videoing the weaver at work.  As Shelley's research trip was funded by the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship, the credit lines for those two pieces needed to reflect the ECDS funding.  Those two pieces were re-numbered 2016.023.001-.002 and given the credit line \"Purchased from the artist with the assistance of the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship\".  The other five textiles were re-numbered so that there is no gap in the numbering, so that they are now 2016.021.001-.005 and have the Bright deaccession credit line.\n",

But it can be more accurately traced stylistically to the first half of Dynasty 19, due to the curvature and elongation of the heads which are typical to the reign of Seti I and Ramesses II. The fine detailing on the bodies and garments is reminiscent of <i>Haaby God of the Nile</i> in the statues of Ramesses II. These bodies, strong yet thin, with graceful bearings and long legs, carved with a razor thin line, are the work of a truly exceptional school–-definitely not run of the mill work using the established patterns of the classical art.

The mummy trappings include the chest covering with rows of protective winged gods, a multicolored bead collar and a winged goddess with arms outstretched holding the feathers of truth above an alternating frieze of hieroglyphs saying “all dominion and life.” The central panel shows Isis and Nepthys mourning over the mummy on a bier under a winged disk, which is framed by the Four Sons of Horus enclosed in shrines and two mourners below. The foot cover depicts sandals with straps and a buckle, with a frieze above of alternating djed-pillars and ankh signs between two representations of Anubis on his shrine.

On the rest of the mummy trappings, the application of gold leaf was ritual, rather than decorative, and often obfuscates the details painted beneath. The chest trapping presents several elements (photo 46). In the top section, a magnificent vulture, the goddess Nekhbet, stretches its wings across the central section, while heads of the falcon god Horus Horakhti anchor the upper corners. In the next section, the following scene is repeated three times: Taosir, sitting between mirror images of the hieroglyphic symbol meaning ‘eternity’, is sheltered between the protective wings of the snake goddess Wadjet and the vulture goddess Nekhbet (photo 47). “Wadjet is in harmony with her southern counterpart Nekhbet—in temples or tombs she can frequently be seen with the full body or just the wings of the vulture goddess of Upper Egypt” (Hart 1986:220). Then comes a sumptuous great usekh collar, with sixteen rows of intricate geometric patterns. Beneath the collar sits Goddess Isis, stretching her protective wings. She wears a white headband and the solar disk, and holds in each hand the feather of Maat (photo 48). Beneath the Isis scene is an understated rectangular register containing a phonetic transcription of the name of the god Thot ‘the scribe of the gods’ (Budge 1969:408), in triplicate (photo 49). The abdominal trapping (photo 50) is dominated by an embalming scene. Under a winged solar disk with two uraeus, the body of Taosir lays on a bed. Beneath the bed stand the traditional four canopic jars holding her stomach, liver, lungs, and intestines. Seated on either side of the funeral bed are two instances of the goddess Nephtys, whose headdress spells her name: ‘neb-hut’ (lady of the mansion). By deference to the goddess, she is shown considerably larger than the deceased (photo 57). Below that scene, on the sides of a large decorative geometrical panel, are four green shrines containing the four Sons of Horus, guardians of the four canopic jars pictured in the\n",

      "in the collection of Princess Maddevi Yukanthor-Norodom. The Mask The gilded face is framed by a large green wig. The Collar This gilded cartonnage collar once rested on the chest of the mummy, just below the mask. Under the wing tips of the scarab are seated representations of Hor-Ma-Khis with solar disks. Below the scarab, in the center panel, is a seated Osiris facing a standing figure praying to him. Cartonnage Cartonnage was a material used in the production of personal funerary ornamentation (masks, pectorals, foot casings, and sometimes whole coffins). It was made with several layers of linen glued together and shaped in a mold. The resulting shell was usually coated on one side with gesso (a mixture of glue and whiting plaster). This smooth medium was well suited to detailed painting and gold leafing. Although earlier examples are known, it is around Dynasty 18 that cartonnage became a material of choice, and it remained a popular medium through the roman period. In later times, the linen layers were sometimes replaced with recycled papyrus documents. Many of the papyri studied by Egyptologists were removed from cartonnage. Chest Panel This piece laid on the chest of the mummy, just below the collar. It depicts Goddess Mut kneeling, her wings spread out in protection. She holds the feather of Maat, symbol of truth and justice. Above her arms stand the four Sons of Horus, protectors of the mummy's viscera (internal organs). Abdominal Panel The top register portrays the god Anubis presiding over mummification rituals in the presence of the Four Sons of Horus. The mummy is laying on a high Sakhmet-headed bed. Anubis holds the deceased's heart in his left hand. Essential parts are gilded. In the next register, a scarab spreads its wings in protection of the deceased. The two Horus with the sun discs and the body of the scarab are gilded. The bottom register presents a dedication flanked by geometric patterns.

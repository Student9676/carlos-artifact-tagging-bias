Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs.  The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC.\n3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.  Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs.  The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence.\n5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC.  Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware.  Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.  More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5)\n11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration.  Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed.\n12. These figurines, found throughout the Persian Empire from Iran to the Levant, are often called ¿Persian riders¿ since their headgear, consisting of a hat covering the chin and cheeks, was the national headdress of the Persians.\n1.

This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth's surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.  Thus, the sculptures safely and symbolically contradicted that isolation by stressing the continued bonds between people in the two realms.  \"\"\n\nBlack lighting results:\nRight leg was broken; right knee a lighter color; everything else looks ok.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art \n\nLarge, well-made ceramic sculptures and vessels filled the tombs of ancient western Mexico and accompanied the dead on their afterlife journey. Male-female pairs (12, 13) and dogs (16) are the most common sculptural subjects. The images of matching couples reveal an interest in showing human connections, a logical concern when the living and the dead are separated. Dogs, loyal companions since they came over from Asia across the Bering Strait with the first Americans, are also reunited with their masters via clay effigies in burials. Well-made bowls with geometric patterns (14) or human faces (15) likely held food intended to feed the soul of the deceased.\n\nTiny architectural models in stone (8, 9), also placed in burials, seem to represent temples or monuments to the ancestors, which may explain the recumbent figure on the roof of 9. \n\nAn important trade item in early ancient Mesoamerica was obsidian, or volcanic glass (1-7). It was prized primarily for its razor-sharp edge (it is still employed today in some eye surgery). From weapons such as spear points (1, 2) to cutting tools such as knives (7), obsidian was the material of choice. With great skill, blades (4) could be chiseled off of cores (3, 5, 6), but the process of striking off a blade as thin and translucent as this one, prone to breaking, was difficult to master. The Aztecs mounted such blades along the length of a club for a highly effective weapon. Some obsidian is naturally greenish (1) and was particularly prestigious and rare. \n\nIn Mesoamerican languages the word \"\"green\"\" also means \"\"precious.\"\" Utilitarian hand axes were  commemorated in greenstone ceremonial versions (10, 11). Too small to be useful for agricultural work, these fancy axes, known as celts, were found in many parts of Mesoamerica in early times. The form was highly influential southward in Costa Rica, where celts became highly elaborate and worn as necklaces.\n\n1.  Bifacial Pachua Obsidian Point.  Mesoamerica, West Mexico, Colima.

Witten II\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art\nAcross the world, early artistic statements often include female figurines (1–4) probably because pre-industrial societies rely heavily on women’s fertility for survival. This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. Having enough extra food was rare in ancient Mesoamerica, so body fat represented high status there as well. A protruding stomach and large navel (1), characterizing a woman who has given birth, were also prestigious. This figurine is also noteworthy because her arms move—thread looped through holes in the top of the arms and tied behind her neck hold them in various positions. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary.\nIn western Mexico ca. 200 BC to 300 AD clay effigies were sculpted, such as the seated couple (12, 13) and the dog (11). Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. Couples are common subjects, perhaps images of family to stay with the dead members in the afterlife. In any case, the idea of connection between dead and alive is expressed; the cyclical Amerindian worldview does not entirely distinguish between death and life. Dogs were not only earthly companions, but were fattened and consumed in this area, so clay canines symbolize afterlife sustenance as well. As elsewhere, dogs also were believed to guide souls into the Other Side.\nMoving eastward, early Guerrero art featured the Mezcala [mehz cah lah] stone carving style (7, 8). Small, finely ground images of structures, complete with staircases and doors, sometimes include prone figures on top (8). This suggests the elevation of the deceased in/on a temple, implying these were models put in the grave to honor the ancestor. Since life and death were interrelated, the deceased influenced affairs of the living, ensuring the rains, fertility, and so on.\nIn early Central Mexico highly skilled ceramicists hand built large and impressive vessels (5, 6, 9, 10) at the site of Chupícuaro [choo peek wahr oh]. Simple tripods refer to the evolution from baskets to clay containers by painting a diagonal pattern around the rim (5), depicting the spiral finishing of baskets’ tops. More elaborate geometric patterns also follow diagonal formats that defer to the constraints of basket weaving (6, 9, 10). Though no actual textiles survive from this region, we can infer the importance of the fiber arts throughout Mesoamerican antiquity.\n1.

These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey.\n\nSpondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red  color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean. This type of open-centered earspool is typical of the Maya (4, 7) and represents a flower. The earspool would have been held in place by a central bead strung on a string that went through the hole in the earlobe, with more beads behind the earlobe serving as a counterweight.\n\nMaya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 10, 11). Like the painted pieces, a calligraphic line governs the fine incisions on 9, and delicate features are sculpted on the figurines. The latter are actually musical instruments: the mother and child (8) is a whistle, and the two standing females are rattles (10, 11).\n\nGreen stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Even their teeth were inlaid with dots of green (3). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. The pendant is a particularly fine piece, combining a harpy eagle with a human skull. This piece was actually found in Costa Rica, reflecting the practice of trading (or perhaps stealing) jades and recarving them.\n\n1.  Spondylus Shell Earspool.  Mesoamerica, Maya.

Arnett\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nMaya Polychrome Ceramics\nDuring their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts.

At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"\"Ferguson (?)\"\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"\"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field.\n\nAdditionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"\"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\"\".  There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers.  The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson's objects.  It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects.\n\nAccording to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0694.001-.012 were found in Box 65 and Box 72. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 65 contained \"\"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\"\".Box 72 contained \"\"1 pottery lid to jar, 1 large spearhead, 3 small axe heads, 1 large axe head, 1 mortar, 2 hollowed small stone, 37 game stones, 2 pieces fragmented pottery, Box #1 – assorted arrowheads, Box #3 - 40 arrowheads\"\".   It is unclear which objects in X.0694.001-.012 came from Box 65 and which came from Box 72.\n\n\nAt some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"\"education collection\"\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"\"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n\nCurator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed.

One way in which he straddles these two realms is by physically incorporating into his work everyday objects-more often than not things he has found discarded in the street.  In the 1950s Rauschenberg created a series of works called Combines, because they mixed elements of both painting and sculpture, by attaching three-dimensional objects that might be as mundane as an old sock or as startling as a stuffed angora goat to canvas or wooden supports.   Later, working in two dimensions, the artist began to insert the real world into his work by transferring photographs and headlines from newspapers and popular magazines directly onto paper by rubbing them with solvent.  Beginning in 1962, when he was introduced to the technique by Andy Warhol, Rauschenberg began to reproduce these fragments of publications onto paper and canvas via the technique of silkscreen or screen printing.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Rauschenberg's work manifested an interest in politics and contemporary events, but as the decade wore on his attitude changed from one of  buoyant optimism to a growing unease that culminated in the series of prints shown here,  Surface Series (from Currents) and Features (from Currents).  Daily newspapers from major cities across the United States were the ¿real-world¿ materials that he used to make these works.  In January and February of 1970 he clipped headlines, articles, photographs, and advertisements from the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the Minneapolis Tribune, the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Once he had selected the texts and images, Rauschenberg assembled the cuttings into thirty-six collages, titled Currents. These collages were then photographed to produce screens for one colossal print and the two portfolios shown in this exhibition.  In these portfolios, Rauschenberg capitalized on the flexibility of the technique by using individual screens multiple times. This recycling of imagery is most striking in Surface Series where the layering of three screens in a single impression results in a dense and indistinct image.\n\nRauschenberg characterized these prints as ¿the most serious journalism I had ever attempted.¿  The two series, composed from the ephemeral medium of newspapers, form what is essentially a permanent scrapbook to convey his message about the deteriorating state of a world threatened by environmental hazards, racial violence, strife in the Middle East, and an unpopular war in Southeast Asia.   Just as in the daily paper, serious concerns compete with the trivial and merely lurid.   In Features (from Currents #55), a headline at the margin  recounts a criminal incident involving an ¿ex-coed¿ and  a ¿hippies' landlord,¿  while, more prominently, headlines about a Black Panther courtroom fracas and events in the conflict between Egypt and Israel frame a Peanuts cartoon and a photograph of a debonair Noel Coward.  By fixing the transient flux of current events in a work of art, Rauschenberg sought to more effectively focus public attention on the state of the world, or as he expressed it, ¿I made that series. . . because, knowing that it was art, people had to take a second look, at least, at the facts they were wrapping their garbage in.¿\n\nApril 1993 descriptor moved.\n\nHand printed silkscreens.

The cowrie shells that make up the fringe of each apron were imported from the East African coast. Bold, multi-hued, geometric patterns exemplify the 'Kirdi' apron style. The complex checkerboard compositions in 1,3, and 6 are based on international naval signal flags that were probably copied from a mission or school library book. Seven actual flag designs can be identified in 1, but flag patterns are also freely adapted to create innovative designs as seen in 3 and 6. When reconfigured in this novel art form, the beaded naval flag patterns communicate new kinds of messages. Worn around the waist during festive occasions, the patterns and colors of the aprons indicate  the wearer's ethnic affiliation and status in life as either an unwed girl, married woman, widow, or elder.  1-6  Aprons.

In ancient Peru the Nasca culture is well known for this: archaeologists find caches of skulls indicating actual stockpiling of “trophy heads.” Images in ceramic painting likewise illustrate such deceased and disembodied heads: 2 shows them with the characteristic slit eyes, jagged bloodstreams, wedges of loose black hair, and two vertical spines piercing the lips (to keep them closed during rigor mortis). They are shown upside down, a further indication that they are dead, i.e., in the afterlife, an inverted Underworld. The upright heads in 3 are also clearly dead, their features reduced to three lines and the whole background taken up with long black hair (used by living figures (4 and 5) to carry trophy heads).\nAll the heads in 4 are also deceased, with closed crescent-shaped eyes. Four heads also display the lip spines. However, one represents a disembodied head as the loincloth: to place one over a man’s genitals conflates life and death, suggesting not all such heads correspond to the war realm. (The head/loincloth is repeated on 6.) Other heads jut out from the long animal-headed emanation, an obviously non-terrestrial element that represents the shaman’s animal-self and/or bizarre bodily transformations experienced\nduring trance. Thus, heads also signify the visionary realm—shamans associate visions with the head since all the senses occur there, whereas the body may not be felt at all.\nReinforcing that not all heads are fully dead, on the back of the figures in 6 and held by the figure in 5 are heads that feature the pierced lips combined with open (i.e., living) eyes. These eyes feature pupils dangling from the upper lid, a common symbol for feline eyes, which do look like this. Jaguar and puma animal-selves are extremely common in shamanism since a powerful animal-self is most effective for curing illness, defeating lesser shamans, etc.\nLikewise, 1 features a lower row of feline-eyed heads, their mouths without spines, which are not shown dead in any way except being bodiless. They seem to be vision heads as well, impossibly shown half alive (open eyes) and half dead (spines on mouths); shamans freely traverse the worlds of the living and the dead during their out-of-body trances.

From foodgrinding platforms known as metates (11, 12) to weapons such as mace heads (5-7), from hand axes used to clear land (8-10) to bark beaters used to make cloth (3, 4), utilitarian forms were transformed into \"\"art-tools.\"\" Changes from the practical tool to the work of art range from adding imagery, such as birds to a metate (12) or a human figure to an axe (10), to reducing the tool to a miniature size (7, 8). Much more time and skill than was \"\"necessary\"\" was lavished on an axe head (1, 2) or the handle of a pestle (14). Yet neither a tiny mace head nor a dull ceremonial axe can really function at all.\n\nThese intriguing hybrid objects found throughout Costa Rican art seem to have been made in order to show the power of the high-status person over lower-status workers. Art-tools symbolize the woman?s grinding of flour, the warrior?s defense of his territory, and the farmer?s clearing of land by referring to their tools but transforming them into ceremonial versions. An agricultural axe becomes a necklace when made in a more precious material (10), but its shape is still easily recognizable to all and so effectively communicates the idea that the wearer has power over farming and, by extension, nature itself.  \n\n1.

An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC.  Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran.  Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery.  The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch.  The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders.  The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses.\n1-4. The rich tombs in the Gilan province of northern Iran have revealed large quantities of metalwork ranging from gold and silver bowls and beakers to bronze figurines of animals and weapons.  Daggers and spearheads of different shapes and sizes were extremely numerous and were left exclusively in graves belonging to men.  Unlike those at Luristan, bronze weapons lacked elaborate decoration and reflects an isolate, artistic tradition.\n8-15. The metalworkers of Luristan produced a wide variety of bronze objects which incorporated the stunning imagery of native animals and mythical beasts.  Animal forms ranged in style from natural to abstract and were generally cast or hammered into shape as zoomorphic handles or projections on weapons and tools.\n8. Since bronze required continual sharpening to maintain a useful edge, whetstones were an important piece of equipment used to hone the edges of daggers, swords, spears, arrows and axes.  Whetstone handles were often cast into zoomorphic representations or animals.  The ibex was the most popular choice, perhaps because of its most striking attribute - its sweeping curved horns.  In almost all cases, these were curved into a convenient loop from which the whetstone was suspended.\n10.  The importance of the horse in ancient Luristan is documented by the large number of surviving horse trappings and decorative harness fittings.  Cheekpieces, like this example, were attached to the harness bit and were often cast in a variety of forms ranging from horses, mouflons, and boars to mythical sphinxes, griffins, and master-of-animals.  Representations of figured cheekpieces appear on sculptured reliefs from Assyria, dating to the late eighth and seventh centruries BC, and indicate that these e fittings had a market outside of Luristan.\n11. At the turn of the first millennium BC, metalworkers often produced bi-metallic tools and weapons with blades made of iron and decorative elements cast in bronze.  This sword hilt's decorative elements consist of a circular pommel decorated with two bearded human and lion head and two crouching lions which form the dagger guard.  Nearly ninety iron examples of this sword type have been found and their complicated, unique, and nearly identical manufacture suggests a close association between the workshops in Luristan.12-14. Standard finials are the hallmark object of Luristan art and its bronze industry between the tenth and seventh centuries BC.  These objects were mounted on bottle-shaped supports by means of a central tube or pin and are meant to be seen from both sides.  Their iconography is striking, varying from rampant goats (12) and lions to the exotic master- or mistress-of-animals (13, 14) representations where abstract human-like bodies are fused with stylize lions, goats, birds, and mythical, fantastic beasts.  Only a few standard finials have been recovered from excavated tombs and sanctuaries and are best interpreted as representations of local gods, deities, or demons.\n1. Socketed Spearhead.

Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horse trappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature that displayed a distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the lost wax technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by means of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horse breeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle, and horses.\n\n1.

Spotted cats may be shown with the body as the bowl itself (1, 2, 6), may carry a bowl on the back (4, 5, 7), or may perch on a bowl that is portrayed as something else, such as a tree (3). Jaguars are skilled tree climbers, so 3 is not fantastical in any way.\n\nIn all these pieces, the feline's body is painted or incised to suggest spots, even though some appear to be stripes. There are no tigers in the Americas; however, the lower limbs and chest of a jaguar may appear somewhat striped, as smaller rosettes can fuse into lines, therefore a striped cat may still represent a jaguar. Other spotted felines existed in Costa Rica (margays, ocelots, and others), but jaguars are by far the largest and most impressive (an ocelot's weight is one-tenth that of a jaguar). A vessel like 7, with ears more pointed than rounded, may well represent a smaller feline, however.\n\nThe bowl may serve to hold the incense in an incense burner (4, 5), in which case the jaguar figure below acts as the legs. In this same Potosi style crocodilians perch on incense burner lids. There may be a distinction being drawn between the crocodile as the earth's surface, a widespread ancient American belief, and the jaguar as the king of the Underworld, also a broadly held idea. Jaguars are largely nocturnal, their spots resemble reversed stars, and they are avid swimmers, so the associations with the dark, wet night of the Underworld are strong. Given this cosmic structure, it would be natural to place jaguars below and crocodiles above in incense burner compositions.\n\nBy analogy with the Potosi examples, 5 may also be the base of a small incense burner. The pieces in which the bowl is the body (1, 2, 6) could have held almost anything, or nothing at all, in rituals or the burial. The prevalent belief in shamanism that all things are alive, including art, means that a vessel is complete even when empty. It may also have been envisioned to contain the ephemeral spirit of whatever it portrayed, in this instance the spirit of the jaguar, which is often considered the shaman's animal self.\n\n1.\tRectangular Bowl with Modeled Jaguar Heads.

Cofradia Mantel.\n\nTextile Rotation 2 label:\nMaya Textiles with Double-Headed Eagle Motifs\nAs seen in a textile in the Panamá gallery, the double-headed eagle, because it represented the ruling Hapsburg house, was introduced into Central and South America after the Spanish took control of “Latin” America. It appears as a recurrent theme in Maya brocade textiles, from Catholic altar cloths (1) to women’s blouses, known as huipiles (2). Although it is an imposed symbol with strong political overtones, the image of a bird with two heads would have resonated with ancient indigenous shamanic imagery—multi-headed phenomena are closely associated with visions and spirits from otherworldly realms. Double-headed “Vision Serpents” are found throughout ancient American art, for instance, as are bicephalic crocodilians, felines, and certainly birds, as seen throughout the galleries.\nAn altar cloth featuring a large Hapsburg eagle exemplifies the close ties between the Spanish crown and the post-Reformation Catholic mission, both of which overlaid and blended with native shamanism. In both pieces odd animals, like those seen in visions, are sprinkled in with recognizably Spanish images; the curly-tailed creatures alternating with the chalices in the huipil epitomize this creative juxtaposition of sacred imagery from both indigenous and foreign cultures. Furthermore, the eagle being spread among the diamonds, zigzags, and fantastical elements may dilute the superficial message of Spanish political power.

The vibrant purple was likely achieved by extracting pigment from sea snails (Plicopurpura pansa [see technical note]) that live along the eastern Pacific coast from Mexico to Perú.

There were, however, many settlements in existence along the Nile valley. Most of these are known today less from their living sites than from their cemeteries that were situated in the Upper Egyptian desert and are thus easily accessible to archaeologists.\n\nThe dead were buried in a contracted position in shallow pits dug in the sand and were surrounded by grave goods consisting of pots, which probably contained food and drink, and personal items like cosmetic palettes. These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n\nThe preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n\t\nSlate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period. They were used for grinding various ores, such as galena (lead sulphide) or malachite (copper carbonate) in order to produce eye make-up, which was worn by both men and women. \n\t\nFinely finished pottery in red and black was characteristic of the Upper Egyptian predynastic and formed part of an African ceramic tradition that continues through the present day. \n\n\n1.

The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine \njewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w).\n\nWhat is most fascinating about making necklaces from axes is that the complete celt (4-6) was also subdivided in many ways and those pieces then worn as necklaces (7-17). This complex splitting process shows that the artist was able to make a complete celt and then to break it, despite the hardness of the material, so that the part still reflected its place in the original whole. The agricultural tool shape had to be honored since it was the key to the statement of power over nature made by the wearer. Half celts (7-9) are the front or the back face of a whole celt, made by carving a whole celt in from both sides until the front could be snapped off the back. The bumpy ridge, or septum, was left (9), as evidence of successful snapping. Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"\"mother\"\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"\"children.\"\"\n\n1-3.  Utilitarian Celts.

The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\nMost greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5). This “art-tool” communicated that the wearer wielded power over agriculture, animals, and other humans.\nYet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n1. Tufted Bird Whole-Celt Pendant\nCentral America, Greater Nicoya, Costa Rica.

The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\nMost greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5). This “art-tool” communicated that the wearer wielded power over agriculture, animals, and other humans.\nYet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n1. Tufted Bird Whole-Celt Pendant\nCentral America, Greater Nicoya, Costa Rica.

Myth served as a means for understanding one's history, social structures, and place in the world.  Closely connected to religion, it played an integral role in many facets of daily life.\n\nArt serves as a key source for our knowledge of classical mythology.  Images of gods and heroes appear in a variety of visual media, including sculpture, wall painting, vase painting, mosaics, and coins.  Deities or heroes may be shown alone (1-2, 4) or in narrative scenes of myth (5).  We are able to recognize particular figures by identifying elements called attributes, by age and dress, and by the specific scenes in which they appear.  For example, a hunter and a woman shown with a boar's head and pelt on a Roman mirror (5) create a scene from the myth of the Calydonian Boar Hunt.\n\nThe marble head (1) and terracotta statuette (2) seen in this case both depict the hero Herakles, or Hercules as he was known in Roman mythology.  Both representations reflect the attitude of the famous fourth-century statue, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" by Lysippos.  The now-lost original statue depicted the aging Herakles leaning on his club, exhausted after having completed his twelve labors.  In his right hand, placed behind his back, Herakles held the apples of the Hesperides, the fruits of his penultimate labor and symbol of the immortality he would be granted by Zeus (Jupiter).  One of the most popular monuments of Greek sculpture, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" was much reproduced, from its own time through the Roman Empire.\n\n The mirror (5) and sarcophagus fragment (3) both feature narrative hunt scenes.

Images of boar hunting appear frequently on Roman sarcophagi, with the heroized hunter suggesting the strength, courage, and noble character of the deceased.  Often such scenes represent the great mythological hunters Meleager,  Hippolytos,  or  Adonis.  Unfortunately,  too  little  of  this  relief survives to determine if the original composition represented a mythological encounter.  The mirror (5), however, certainly shows a rare scene from the myth of hunting the Calydonian Boar, the ferocious beast sent to ravage the countryside by the angry goddess Artemis (Diana).  The virgin huntress Atalanta wounded the boar first; the king's son Meleager killed it but offered to share its pelt and head with Atalanta, whom he loved deeply.  The scene here shows the boar's head resting on a rustic altar between the lovers and before a statue of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.  The tone of the scene is quiet and intimate, as befits a personal object; we can contrast the crowded and complex composition of the sarcophagus fragment.\n\n1. Head of Herakles.

Myth served as a means for understanding one's history, social structures, and place in the world.  Closely connected to religion, it played an integral role in many facets of daily life.\n\nArt serves as a key source for our knowledge of classical mythology.  Images of gods and heroes appear in a variety of visual media, including sculpture, wall painting, vase painting, mosaics, and coins.  Deities or heroes may be shown alone (1-2, 4) or in narrative scenes of myth (5).  We are able to recognize particular figures by identifying elements called attributes, by age and dress, and by the specific scenes in which they appear.  For example, a hunter and a woman shown with a boar's head and pelt on a Roman mirror (5) create a scene from the myth of the Calydonian Boar Hunt.\n\nThe marble head (1) and terracotta statuette (2) seen in this case both depict the hero Herakles, or Hercules as he was known in Roman mythology.  Both representations reflect the attitude of the famous fourth-century statue, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" by Lysippos.  The now-lost original statue depicted the aging Herakles leaning on his club, exhausted after having completed his twelve labors.  In his right hand, placed behind his back, Herakles held the apples of the Hesperides, the fruits of his penultimate labor and symbol of the immortality he would be granted by Zeus (Jupiter).  One of the most popular monuments of Greek sculpture, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" was much reproduced, from its own time through the Roman Empire.\n\n The mirror (5) and sarcophagus fragment (3) both feature narrative hunt scenes.  The stone fragment, carved in high relief, preserves the upper bodies of two hunters-one on horseback-who close in on a boar that rushes to the right.  Images of boar hunting appear frequently on Roman sarcophagi, with the heroized hunter suggesting the strength, courage, and noble character of the deceased.  Often such scenes represent the great mythological hunters Meleager,  Hippolytos,  or  Adonis.  Unfortunately,  too  little  of  this  relief survives to determine if the original composition represented a mythological encounter.  The mirror (5), however, certainly shows a rare scene from the myth of hunting the Calydonian Boar, the ferocious beast sent to ravage the countryside by the angry goddess Artemis (Diana).  The virgin huntress Atalanta wounded the boar first; the king's son Meleager killed it but offered to share its pelt and head with Atalanta, whom he loved deeply.  The scene here shows the boar's head resting on a rustic altar between the lovers and before a statue of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.  The tone of the scene is quiet and intimate, as befits a personal object; we can contrast the crowded and complex composition of the sarcophagus fragment.\n\n1. Head of Herakles.

The communities grew steadily, nowhere more so than at Constantinople, the city inaugurated with massive ambition by Constantine in 324 AD on the site of a former Greek city, Byzantium, as the capital of the Eastern part of the Roman Empire. Constantinople survived the Germanic invasions of Rome in the fifth century and lent its earlier name, Byzantium, to an important and sophisticated culture that would last until 1453 AD when Turkish troops led by Sultan Mehmed II finally broke through the city walls. The flight of the nobility and intellectual elite from Constantinople to Western Europe was a major force in the emergence of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n\nThe pantheon of Olympian gods, however, continued to attract worshippers well beyond 313 AD, particularly in remoter parts. The earliest material evidence for the profound change to a monotheistic religion, Christianity, can be sense in pottery made in Roman North Africa. Alongside representations of myths familiar from the classical world (17-22), we encounter commemoration of individuals like Thecla (25), a disciple of St. Paul, and the appearance of Christograms (23-24). The cross on the intaglio (36) denotes an early Christian family probably living in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n\n1. Standard Fitting with Busts of Sol, Luna, and Saturn.

Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked.\nThe Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). The brown open mouth with serrated teeth painted across her jaw aptly depicts the whale shark’s giant maw, filled with thousands of tiny, shark-like teeth. Even the white line down her back corresponds to the white edge of the whale shark’s dorsal fin. To have the powers of such a mighty animal —females, larger than the males, can reach over forty feet long—would have been impressive indeed.\nColombia is renown for having one of the planet’s largest gold sources. The nosering (6), ear rod (5), and labret (4) mask the lower face by dangling a lightweight beaten gold sheet from the septum, decorating the earlobe with a cylindrical earring pushed through a large hole, and elaborating the area between the mouth and chin with an inserted flange, respectively. Gold, not only reflective but extremely permanent, defying tarnish for millennia, signaled elevated social status. Jewelry was buried with the body, in the widespread Amerindian belief that the soul went to an afterlife with his or her possessions.\nThe large urns (1, 3) were buried containing the bones, the similarly permanent body parts, and the gold of the deceased. Expressing the deceased’s hope of being reborn on the Other Side, images of powerful females are typical in burial urn imagery.

With an accentuated navel as well as delineated genitalia, 1 shows that women also played key spiritual roles.\n1.

Representation of crocodiles. The earlier repair on the piece is breaking. Worth fixing.\n\nComment on condition:\nNeeds help.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nCrocodiles, Real and Unreal \n\nOnly a few of the many works of art from ancient Costa Rica represent the crocodile as it appears in nature (5, 6), while most give the creature two heads (1, 2, 4, 7).  Crocodiles shown more realistically, such as the pair of matched flutes (5, 6), feature the upturned heads, protruding eyes and nostrils, long teeth-filled jaws, and the body ridges characteristic of this awesome reptile.  However, in these pieces the tails are necessarily shortened so as to function as a mouthpiece.\n\nIn the double-headed images, which are much more common, the symmetrical heads serve as matching handles for bowls (1, 2), tripod vessels (7), or the bench on which a figure sits (4). However, this practical design feature does not explain the choice of the fantastical; a tail would work as a handle as well as another head. In the shamanic art of the ancient Americas, double-headed creatures, especially snakes and crocodilians, are ubiquitous. They may reflect the fact that all kinds of frightening things are experienced during the shaman's ritual trance, including bizarre attacking crocodiles. \n\nThe figure on the bench (4) is a key to this association of the supernatural with the two-headed crocodile. It depicts a female shaman whose popping eyes and bumpy head seem to suggest those features of the crocodile. Her legs are transforming into faces, and a snake encircles her waist. One hand-with ten fingers!-grasps a cup that might have held a mind-altering substance. She is a shaman in a trance, melding her human self with her animal one, and it is significant that she is elevated on a bench that sports two crocodile heads. This kind of bench has not been found archaeologically, so it may have been made of wood instead of a permanent material like stone. Another piece (7) joins the bicephalic (two-headed) crocodile with a painted bird design, probably a reference to shamanic trances that also involve a sense of flying like a bird.\n\nShamans as dual beings, both crocodile and human, are depicted in 3. Diving downward, as if into the watery underworld, the applique figures feature human faces and arms along with ridged crocodile tails and back feet.\n\n1. \tFooted Shallow Bowl with Double Crocodile Heads. \n\tCentral America, Costa Rica, Atlantic Watershed, El Rio Applique. \t\t\tPeriod V, AD 500-800.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation Label:\nAndean Art\nThe ancient Andean cultural region encompassed the modern countries of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, plus parts of Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked.\nThe Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). The brown open mouth with serrated teeth painted across her jaw aptly depicts the whale shark’s giant maw, filled with thousands of tiny, shark-like teeth. Even the white line down her back corresponds to the white edge of the whale shark’s dorsal fin. To have the powers of such a mighty animal —females, larger than the males, can reach over forty feet long—would have been impressive indeed.\nColombia is renown for having one of the planet’s largest gold sources. The nosering (6), ear rod (5), and labret (4) mask the lower face by dangling a lightweight beaten gold sheet from the septum, decorating the earlobe with a cylindrical earring pushed through a large hole, and elaborating the area between the mouth and chin with an inserted flange, respectively. Gold, not only reflective but extremely permanent, defying tarnish for millennia, signaled elevated social status. Jewelry was buried with the body, in the widespread Amerindian belief that the soul went to an afterlife with his or her possessions.\nThe large urns (1, 3) were buried containing the bones, the similarly permanent body parts, and the gold of the deceased. Expressing the deceased’s hope of being reborn on the Other Side, images of powerful females are typical in burial urn imagery. Here an egg-shaped pregnant women (3), her navel everted, and nude meditating female shaman (1) show different sides of female authority. With an accentuated navel as well as delineated genitalia, 1 shows that women also played key spiritual roles.\n1.

Its natural defenses and the availability of water made the site desirable as a citadel and dwelling place. It has been continuously inhabited\nsince Neolithic times, ca. 5000 bc. By the early sixth century bc it had become a sanctuary sacred to the goddess Athena. In 480 bc the Persians invaded Athens, and the Acropolis was overrun, its temples, dedications, and sculptures all\ndestroyed and burned. The monuments now visible on its summit are the remnants of a grand building scheme begun in the middle of the fifth century bc under the statesman Perikles, after the defeat of Persia and the rise of Athens to empire. From left to right on the summit are the Erechtheion, the Parthenon, the Propylaia, and the small temple of Athena Nike, all constructed between 447 and 404 bc in white\nmarble quarried from Mount Pentelicon northeast of Athens. The dark tower just to the left of the temple of Athena Nike is the so-called Frankish Tower, built by a Florentine family, the Acciaiuoli, who ruled as Dukes of Athens from the late\nfourteenth century until the Ottoman conquest in 1458.\n\nThe Eye of Greece intro text:\nThe Eye of Greece\nAthens in Nineteenth-Century Photographs\nWhen the English poet John Milton called Athens ¿the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts and Eloquence¿ in Paradise Regained (1671), he echoed the opinion of untold generations who had looked on the city as the center of culture and civilization ever since its rise to greatness under the statesman Perikles in the fifth century bc. It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\nFive years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.\n\nObjects in Lot 1:\n1985.023.011\nX.0019.001\nX.0019.005\nX.0019.006\nX.0019.007\nX.0019.008\nX.0019.009\nX.0019.011\nX.0019.013\nX.0019.016\nX.0019.017\nX.0019.018\nX.0019.019\nX.0019.020\nX.0019.021\nX.0019.026\nX.0019.027\nX.0019.029\nX.0019.032\nX.0019.033\nX.0019.035\nX.0019.036\nX.0019.037\nX.0019.041\nX.0019.046\nX.0019.047\nX.0019.048\nX.0019.049\nX.0019.052\nX.0019.053\nX.0019.054\nX.0019.055\nX.0019.056\nX.0019.058\nX.0019.060\nX.0019.062\nX.0019.063\nX.0019.064\nX.0019.065\nX.0019.066\nX.0019.070 A/B\n\nNo provenance information in files.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias.

Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric desings of zigzags, lozenges and triangles.\"\"\n\nThe Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n1. Sickle.  Ur.  Ubaid, 5500-4300 BC.  Clay.  American Scientific Mission, 1920.  1921.150\n2.

Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\nDuring the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\nMold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\nThe theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n\n1. Plaque with Banquet Scene. Sumerian.

Both media seem practical in their uses, but achieve elevated aesthetic status in their interpretations.  High technical achievement in both art forms was characteristic, despite the simple stone and wood tools with which they were created. Beautifully incised ceramic spindle whorls (1) were mounted on long, thin, wooden spindles and used to hold the thread during spinning.  Their individualized patterning shows that even functional objects related to textile production were seen as worthy of artistic treatment.  The intricately woven belt (5) also exceeds practical requirements with its high thread count and detailed designs. Gold and copper were hammered (2, 3) and cast (4) into objects of great delicacy.  Nose ornaments (2) hung off the septum to cover much of the face, which was kept free of hair by the use of tweezers (3).  The lightness and flexibility of gold alloy made it possible for them to fulfill these uses, while the immutable shine of plain expanses and raised designs made them markers of high social status.  In later ancient times another copper alloy we call bronze was used for such items as bells (4), remarkably cast with the clappers inside.  1.  Spindle Whorls.

Textiles were valued so highly that these tools were themselves made into works of art. The term \"\"art-tool' describes this type of practical aesthetic object that is characteristic of all ancient American cultures.\n\nFirst, to spin the thread, spindles (1-4) were carved from wood and spindle whorls (6-16) modeled from clay. A spindle is a thin, smooth stick that the spinner turns around to give twist to the strands of raw fiber. The spindle winds the thread onto its shaft above a bead or cylinder, a spindle whorl (3, 6-16). A bit of unspun fiber, wrapped around the shaft, serves to hold the spindle whorl in place (2). The spindle can be used as a bobbin (4), carrying the thread during the weaving process.\n\nBoth spindles and whorls were decorated in the Andes. The spindles were painted with stripes (visible only before the thread was made or after the bobbin was emptied). The whorls were incised with geometric patterns. Like the \"\"invisible\"\" spindle decoration, the whorl's patterns are not seen by the spinner, as the decorated side is down. Andean cultures valued art that was not necessarily visible to humans, as part of their belief in the shamanic visions that were not accessible to most people.\n\nWeaving also necessitated tools, such as flat wooden battens (5), used both to pick up particular warp threads for elaborate patterns and to pack down the wefts to achieve a dense cloth. Carved at the wide end, battens were also treated as simple works of art in their own right.\n\n1-4 Spindles.  South America, Central Andes, Central Coast.  Date unknown.

Although the subject of this one (17) is not known, the Spanish described quipus as recording the census, tribute, and crops, as well as astronomy, history, and poetry. As we know from computers, based only on zeros and ones, all information can be reduced to numbers, whether quantities and codes or abstract concepts. In fact, Inka mathematics and ours are identical base-10 systems, with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, fractions, and zero.\n\nEqually abstract geometric designs covered the clothing of Inka administrators. This pattern (18), known as the Inka Key, features four squares, two of which are connected by a diagonal line. The Inka called their vast empire Tawantinsuyu [tah-wahn-tin-soo-yoo], the Land of the Four Quarters, an idea encapsulated by this pattern. The high-status men who wore this tunic oversaw the world's largest empire in AD 1500.   \n\n17.  Quipu (Knot Record). Central Andes, Inka. Late Horizon,   AD 1430-1534.

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n\nAccording to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n\nX.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah.  I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo.\n\nThere is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0309. It notes the provenance as \"\"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\"\". It also notes the \"\"Field Number\"\" as \"\"Box 41\"\". The cigar box note associated with Box 41 reads \"\"Pottery Fragments Tumlin Village Site and a few other objects\"\" As X.0309 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 41 originally contained X.0309 and X.0612.001-.002.\n\nThe memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"\"Specimen Record\"\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.  It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.  Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.\n\n\nAt some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"\"education collection\"\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"\"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n\nCurator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed.

Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). \n\nImages that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have fit into the ring above their heads). Likewise, in 5, a large oval metate (grinding platform), the women form the legs that support the plate, most likely used for making maize into flour. Their hands rest on their bellies in a gesture of fertility (perhaps one of the messages of the piece being that the maize food nourishes the generations of mothers and children). Female images made into vessels (4) also explicitly combine human fertility (her navel is everted as in pregnancy) with plentiful food. The woman as a vessel for life is aptly conveyed. \n\nThe tiny severed heads that encircle the metate's plate seem to represent the simultaneous giving and taking of life, in a probable analogy with the harvesting of maize kernels. Thus, through the metaphors of humans and maize the cycle of life itself is celebrated. The same kind of festive action in 1 may be related to the food stored in the pot above the dancers. Certainly in pre-industrial society a full food jar or a good harvest ready to be processed on a milling stone were key to survival and power. Men's and women's complementary contributions to this success were honored in ancient Costa Rican art.   \n\n1.  Pot Stand with Ring of Dancing Figures and Large Birds.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nWomb Vessels\nIn pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\nA bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \nThe other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\nAppliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\nOther images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual.

After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"\"bone\"\" and \"\"seed\"\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"\"immortal\"\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n\n1, 3.Negative-Painted Secondary Burial Urns.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nArt of Ancient Ecuador\nEcuador, between Colombia and Peru, is considered part of the Northern Andes in ancient times, though it was partly conquered by the Inka in the sixteenth century. It was a very creative area, making female figurines (2, 3) and weaving cloth on looms (represented by the skirt depicted in 6) well before adjacent regions. Some of its practices relate to the Colombian and lower Central American cultures, such as secondary burial in large urns (1, 7) and roller stamped body decoration (5). Secondary burial means the deceased was allowed to decompose and the bones placed in giant vessels, which were then buried on the anniversary of the death. The face painted on 7 suggests the reanimation of these permanent body parts on the Other Side; indeed, the word for “bone” is the word for “seed” in this area, expressing the idea that the bones will grow another person.\nMany distinct styles followed one another in Ecuador, from the early expressive Chorrera [cho rare rah] (4, 8) dated 700–300 bc, to the later, delicate Jama-Coaque [hah mah co wa kay] (6). The seated Chorrera figure (8) shuts his eyes, holds his mirror necklace, and displays quids of coca in his cheeks, all indications that he is a shaman in trance (mirrors were divination tools and coca was used to maintain consciousness for lengthy rituals). The standing Jama-Coaque female effigy (6) represents a high-status woman in a turban, wrapped skirt, and gold jewelry. The clay slabs standing for cloth draping between her head and shoulders are impressive—clay dries at different rates and such suspended parts are prone to destruction from the moment they are created. Post-fired paint suggests the bright yellow headwrap and black skirt of a beautifully adorned young woman, whose arms show the imprint of patterns that may have been stamped, tattooed, or scarified on an actual person.\n1.

The  commemorated ancestor sits on an ornate chair, wearing a stovepipe hat and clothes, while protected from the elements by a figure holding an umbrella. All of these status symbols indicate the wealth and standing of the deceased. The Christian cross, also seen on (2), indicates a familiarity with Portuguese Catholicism, but the cross is also a symbol of Mawu, the female half of the Fon creator couple and an apotropaic symbol. The chameleon holding the cutlass atop the tree represents Lisa, the male half of the creator couple. He signifies transformation.

As in (1) the honored person is surrounded by symbols that refer to Fon proverbs. The bird on a stalk of millet prompts the saying: ¿If only one bird remains, he will find a field of millet and eat,¿ suggesting that even if only one child remains, he or she will do everything necessary to properly honor a dead parent. Another element of this tableau is the kpanzon, a wooden column with a bifurcated capital that acts as a guardian spirit for a household.\n\nThe tableau of (2) shows a kneeling figure holding and offering a calabash vessel to two seated figures.

The offering of the calabash is also a metaphor for the connection between the living and the dead; ancestors too drink from the calabash offered by the living.

Carved female and male caryatid figures uphold the ceiling of a verandah or flank doorways. Such a column can be a simple one with a few figures, or an elaborate one with many. The characters probably represent royal guardians or retainers (political allies of the king) who ensure the fertility and welfare of the kingdom.  The elongated form, restrained gesture and large eyes of this figure exhibit the stylistic features of Grassfield architectural sculpture.   Bibliography:  1. Gebauer, P.

Spiny oyster shells were highly valued for their bright orange-red lining, as well as for their ability to induce visions when eaten sparingly during red tides.\n1.

Coggins\n1977.3.7\n\nThis is one of the earliest of Homer's depictions of  beach resorts;  many more were to follow.  The text accompanying the illustration describes ¿the scene by the sea-side-the dolce far niente-the hunt for crustacea-the hour spent in sketching the distant schooner-the delightful tetes-a-tetes-are they not all written in our memories?¿  This pastiche is well-fitted to the miscellaneous incidents collected in Homer's picture.\n\nWinslow Homer in Print intro text:\nWINSLOW HOMER IN PRINT\n\nWinslow Homer (1836-1910), one of the greatest of America's nineteenth-century artists, launched his career in 1857 as a freelance illustrator for popular magazines.  For the most part Homer's illustrations featured imagery with a broad appeal for the audiences of  such publications as Harper's Weekly.  Close examination of the illustrations, however,  reveals the lines of development in his art as a whole.  In the years before the Civil War Homer portrayed scenes crowded with figures and anecdotal details.  His work as a correspondent at the front during the war brought a change not only in subject matter, but also in style.  Scenes of the war came to be more sharply focused, with incidental details trimmed away to give a more dramatic effect.  \nIn the years following the war this clarity was carried over to new subjects.  The simplified, yet sophisticated compositions lent charm and elegance to Homer's depiction of people, particularly women and children, engaged in leisure pursuits in the countryside and at the seashore.   The perils of the sea and the human struggle for survival-subjects which foreshadow Homer's later, greatest paintings-began to appear in the illustrations of the 1870s.  In these years the artist began to concentrate on painting in watercolor and in oil, reworking the motifs of the paintings in his magazine illustrations in order to make his more serious work known to a wider audience.  Finally, in 1875 Homer abandoned the field of illustration altogether to support himself solely by his painting.  \nWood engraving was the predominant method of mass production of images for illustration for magazines in the nineteenth century before the advent of photographic processes in the 1880s.  Artists like Homer executed their designs directly onto a wood block which had been polished and coated with white.  The block was then given to an engraver employed by the publisher, who carved away the bare white parts of the surface with a graver, a small sharpened steel rod.  Cutting across the end grain of the wood made possible finely detailed lines.  The lines drawn by the artist were left in relief, to be printed like type.  The blocks were then inked and sent through the press to create multiple copies of the original design.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias and jargon bias, Subjectie labels: greatest.

Mann conceived the work as “a triptych of fairly long short stories of religious tinge.” However, over a sixteen-year period, he expanded the brief biblical account of Joseph’s life, and that of his father, Jacob, into a complex, four-volume, fifteen-hundred-page narrative. He described this effort as “die Fleischwerdung des Mythos,” the transformation of myth into flesh.\nTo prepare for this imaginative retelling, Mann drew inspiration from a multitude of source materials, including Jewish scriptural exegesis, astrology, comparative mythology, and the history of ancient Egypt. The political climate in Germany leading up to the second World War also influenced Mann’s epic tale. Though of German Protestant heritage, Mann, like many of his compatriots, was deeply affected by Nazi Germany’s genocidal treatment of the Jews. He fled to Switzerland after Hitler’s rise to power, and later, in 1939, emigrated to the United States.\nIn 1942, Mann was introduced to the work of a young Joan Waddell, a student of Mann’s close friend, art historian Wolfgang Born. Born sent Mann two of Waddell’s drawings of Aschenbach, the main character of Mann’s Death in Venice. He was delighted by the drawings, calling them “intellectualized and surrealistic.” It is unclear whether Mann requested Waddell-Barnes to complete this series of illustrations for Joseph and His Brothers, or whether the artist volunteered her services. In any case, correspondence between the two confirms a friendship and both parties’ enthusiasm for the project.\nWaddell-Barnes’ expressionistic style also bends toward surrealism in these illustrations. For example, in Joseph’s Sojourn in the Well, the artist brings the primeval prototypes of a womb and a dead planet out of Joseph’s mind and into the reality of his surroundings. Likewise, Waddell-Barnes blends the forms of Joseph and his mother, Rachel, in Joseph Tries on the Coat of Many Colours. This stylistic choice was made in response to Jacob’s reaction at beholding Joseph, “It was the mother-goddess who stood there before him smiling, in the boy’s lovely guise….”\nA selection of twelve out of the series of eighteen illustrations, given to the Carlos Museum by the artist herself, are presented here. They beautifully capture Mann’s Amarna Period setting and what he termed a narrative of “love and hate, blessing and curse, fraternal strife and paternal grief, pride and penance, fall and rise, a humorous song of mankind.” Although Mann and Waddell-Barnes hoped these illustrations would accompany a two-volume edition of Joseph and His Brothers, it was never published.\n\nGod Spoke the Earth label:\nJoan Waddell-Barnes\n(American, 1921–2008)\nIllustrations for Thomas Mann’s\nJoseph and His Brothers, 1944–45\nPen and ink with wash\n1990.3.1, 3, 5–8, 10–11, 14–16, 18.

He described this effort as “die Fleischwerdung des Mythos,” the transformation of myth into flesh.\nTo prepare for this imaginative retelling, Mann drew inspiration from a multitude of source materials, including Jewish scriptural exegesis, astrology, comparative mythology, and the history of ancient Egypt. The political climate in Germany leading up to the second World War also influenced Mann’s epic tale. Though of German Protestant heritage, Mann, like many of his compatriots, was deeply affected by Nazi Germany’s genocidal treatment of the Jews. He fled to Switzerland after Hitler’s rise to power, and later, in 1939, emigrated to the United States.\nIn 1942, Mann was introduced to the work of a young Joan Waddell, a student of Mann’s close friend, art historian Wolfgang Born. Born sent Mann two of Waddell’s drawings of Aschenbach, the main character of Mann’s Death in Venice. He was delighted by the drawings, calling them “intellectualized and surrealistic.” It is unclear whether Mann requested Waddell-Barnes to complete this series of illustrations for Joseph and His Brothers, or whether the artist volunteered her services. In any case, correspondence between the two confirms a friendship and both parties’ enthusiasm for the project.\nWaddell-Barnes’ expressionistic style also bends toward surrealism in these illustrations. For example, in Joseph’s Sojourn in the Well, the artist brings the primeval prototypes of a womb and a dead planet out of Joseph’s mind and into the reality of his surroundings. Likewise, Waddell-Barnes blends the forms of Joseph and his mother, Rachel, in Joseph Tries on the Coat of Many Colours. This stylistic choice was made in response to Jacob’s reaction at beholding Joseph, “It was the mother-goddess who stood there before him smiling, in the boy’s lovely guise….”\nA selection of twelve out of the series of eighteen illustrations, given to the Carlos Museum by the artist herself, are presented here. They beautifully capture Mann’s Amarna Period setting and what he termed a narrative of “love and hate, blessing and curse, fraternal strife and paternal grief, pride and penance, fall and rise, a humorous song of mankind.” Although Mann and Waddell-Barnes hoped these illustrations would accompany a two-volume edition of Joseph and His Brothers, it was never published.\n\nChat label from God Spoke the Earth:\nThomas Mann’s Response to the Drawings\n“With emotion and admiration I have again and again, alone and together with artloving friends looked at your pictures to Joseph. You have created there something very beautiful and unique, indeed something amazing, and I cannot be grateful enough for the artistic devotion and the enduring and loyal enthusiasm with which you have applied yourself to this task. You have found an approach to the subject which must be called both daring and happy, a style that possesses a free and floating musical rhythm, without ever losing itself into the abstract, a style that is decorative and allegorical and which you master with great formal taste. The pictures are a joy to the eyes and at the same time they are spiritual works of art. Illustrations is too banal a word for them; I would call them a sort of visual music\nscore that accompanies the story, never restricting the reader’s fantasy, but always giving it a pleasing lift.” (1944)\n\nChat label from God Spoke the Earth:\nThomas Mann’s Response to the Drawings\n“With emotion and admiration I have again and again, alone and together with artloving friends looked at your pictures to Joseph.

Drawn from the permanent collections of the Carlos Museum,\nPitts Theology Library, and MARBL (The Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library), this exhibition includes a variety of artistic approaches to the ancient story of creation, from Albrecht Dürer’s famed 1504 engraving, Adam and Eve (The Fall of Man) to Marc Chagall’s 1960 lithograph, Bible II-Creation.\nThe first book of the Torah and the Old Testament, Genesis recounts the origin and beginning of all things. It introduces the Judeo-Christian understanding of a monotheistic God who created and controls the world, and revolves around the sequential themes of creation, sin, re-creation, and redemption. These themes can be traced through the various stories of Genesis, from Creation through the Fall of Man, the Flood, God’s call and promise to Abraham, and more. \nThe works of art in this exhibition span the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, and offer insight into how artists and communities throughout time depicted Genesis narratives and contemplated God’s relationship with mankind. A leaf from a twelfth-century French Bible, the earliest work in the exhibition, depicts a small scene of the Creation of Adam followed by an image of Adam and Eve eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, both in exquisite hand-painted detail. These pictures are followed by a New Testament image of Christ’s crucifixion, reminding the medieval Christian viewer of God’s ultimate redemptive act for the salvation of mankind. Alternately, several works in the exhibition reveal the political climate of the artist’s surroundings. For example, the inscription on a poignant seventeenth-century German drawing of Jacob’s Ladder may draw a comparison between the Redemption of Mankind and the Peace of Westphalia, which brought an end to the Thirty Years War.\nThe title of the exhibition derives from the Creation Story recounted in the second chapter of Genesis, in which God speaks the creation of Earth and all living things. It denotes the mysterious, creative power of the Judeo-Christian God that has captivated and inspired artists, and offers a testament to the lasting importance of stories of Genesis.\n\nGod Spoke the Earth intro label:\nGod Spoke the Earth\nStories of Genesis in Prints and Drawings\nSeptember 12 – December 7, 2014\nGod Spoke the Earth: Stories of Genesis in Prints and Drawings focuses on the enduring narratives of the book of Genesis and highlights the breadth of Emory’s holdings in this genre.

Jericho's population constructed or re-used rock-cut tombs with shafts and subterranean chambers where furniture, mats, baskets, and wooden platters with food remains were found partially preserved. Pottery, jewelry, and other personal items, including alabaster jars for oil or perfume and scarab seals or amulets, were also left with the dead.\nTomb P1 was one of more than one hundred tombs discovered at Jericho dating to the later Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1800-1550 bc). Typical of the period in content and shape, Tomb P1 consisted of a vertical rock-cut shaft leading into a subterranean chamber. It measured 3.3 x 3.8 meters (10 3/4 x 12 1/2 feet) and was closed off by a large blocking stone. Although originally constructed during the previous period,\nthe tomb was reused by Jericho's Middle Bronze Age population.\nInside the chamber, archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon discovered twenty-four skeletons from five successive burial groups. The majority of the skeletons found\nwere those of adults, with only three children among them. To make space for each new burial, many of the bodies and burial offerings were pushed to the rear or\nsides of the chamber or were removed from the tomb altogether.\nBecause of the scattering of the tomb contents, it is impossible to associate particular offerings with specific individuals interred. The limited stylistic\nvariation of the pottery, however, suggests that the tomb was used for a relatively short period of time. Displayed in this case is the full range of artifacts\nexcavated from Tomb P1, except for a cooking pot and the charred remains of wooden stools and/or tables.

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n\nAccording to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on some of the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on an accession worksheet may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n\nX.0232.003 - Accession log lists no source, but lists Etowah as provenance.  There is no mention of an accession worksheet in Lori's memo. However, there is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file. This worksheet lists the provenance as \"\"N. America, Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumin Village Site\"\", though someone bracketed that information and wrote \"\"N/A\"\" next to it. No source is noted.\n\nThe memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"\"Specimen Record\"\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.

Lydia was famous for its textiles and a perfume, bocchoris. The jars in which this was packaged, lydia (6) were distinctive in shape (borrowed from Egypt and widely imitated [10]), and in the marbled glaze that imitated stone vessels, both in Egypt and in Persia (8). Those in turn inspired Greek artisans (11–12).\nLydian friendship with Greek neighbors (17–22) ended in 546 BC when the legendarily wealthy king Croesus (15–16) was defeated by the Persian king Cyrus the Great. Under Cyrus, the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire was fast becoming the most magnificent known\n(8–9, 23).\nSuddenly, Greek cities faced an ambitious neighbor. The Persian Wars, including two attempted invasions, simmered for fifty years (499 to 449 BC). In 490, the Persians lost at Marathon; ten years later, a second invasion prevailed at Thermopylae only to lose at Salamis and Plataea. The boost to Athenian morale from victory at Marathon cannot be exaggerated.\nAthenians led Greek resistance to Persia. Their autocratic ruler (tyrant), Hippias, had been expelled from Athens in 510 BC, taking refuge in the Persian court. A series of reforms under Cleisthenes shortly afterwards then widened the basis of power towards democracy. Fear of Persian invasion may have contributed significantly to the establishment of this new political model—the first the world had known. Athenian democracy was, however, extremely restricted: votes were cast only by Athenian male citizens. Foreign residents (metics), a substantial slave population, and the entire adult female population enjoyed no franchise. Under the democracy, artistic changes can be sensed in the increased number of vases that depict not myths but scenes of everyday life (1,3, 13).\n1.Attic Red-Figure Lekythos Attributed to the Oionokles Painter.

While at first leaving the Acropolis untouched as a memorial, the Athenians began eagerly not only to rebuild their lives but also to take command of an alliance of Greek city states and islands to defend themselves against the continuing Persian threat. This alliance, the Delian League, rapidly became an Athenian empire, with the Athenians exacting taxes and taking interest in government: in 454 BC, the transfer of the League’s from Delos to Athens made this explicit. The empire was short-lived, for war broke out between Athens and Sparta that ended in Athenian defeat in 404. \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth politically and artistically, Athens was the premier city of fifth century Greece. The Persian defeat, the rule of empire and confidence from the radical democracy contributed to an extraordinary creativity: it was in Athens that Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Thucydides and Socrates were born and worked for much of their lives. No one exerted a greater influence on the arts than Perikles: the redevelopment of the Acropolis and its buildings (such as the Parthenon) was his master-plan.

My father was a surgeon, and I would have been the fifth generation of medical men had I become a doctor.  I went to Epsom College, a school for the sons of doctors, but while there came under the spell of my uncle, the bookseller, H. P. Kraus.  On leaving school I went to work for him on the day after my eighteenth birthday, and stayed for nine years.  Among the books that were in stock at one time or another while I was there were a Guttenberg Bible, a folio Audubon, and all four Shakespeare folios at the same time.  in 1972 I left to start Ursus Books, named by my friend, the artist and book maker, Leaonard Baskin.  Based on what I had learnt at H. P. Kraus, I dealt in scholarly art books and rare books of all kinds.  After our children were born, my wife, a librarian by profession, started Ursus Prints, dealing in rare decorative prints, and it has been part of Ursus ever since. \nFor the past two years my shop is on the third floor of 699 Madison Avenue.  The building was designed after World War I to be the New York branch of Fortnum and Mason, and is a miniature version of the Picadilly store.  The Depression intervened and the store never materialized.  Prior to that I was in the Carlyle Hotel for 28 years, but the change in the nature of the book trade made those rather large premises unaffordable.  They are now occupied by a major art dealer. \nI am married with two daughters.  The eldest, Nicola, is the author of The Nanny Diaries, and eight other books, and the younger, Olivia is a lawyer, who has decided to give up law, and came to work in the book shop in August.  I am not a book collector, although I have a large reading library, which is largely non-fiction, consisting mainly of history, biography and travel.  I do, however, very much love and collect Indian miniatures.  I am also a lover of opera, attend the theatre regularly, and surprise am an avid reader, alternating fiction and non-fiction.  I also love to travel, but am never happier than when I return to New York, the greatest city on earth.\nQ:  What is the preferred genre you deal in?\nA:  I much prefer illustrated books, whatever the field, but can always be temped by a great, or special book in any field, although I find myself becoming less and less interested in literature.\nQ:  What is the price range of the books do you deal in?\nA:  I try to start at $500 and go up from there.  At the moment my most expensive book is $500,000.\nQ:  What is the most interesting book you've sold?\nA:  The most interesting book I have ever sold is probably a spectacular early nineteenth century manuscript from the Russian sect of Old Believers.  The illustrations throughout we're quite extraordinary, and because the sect was ruthlessly persecuted, very little of their printed or manuscript work survives. \nQ:  What was your most unexpected or surprising rare book find?\nA:  One of my more surprising finds came several years ago in the private office of a French colleague who tends to specialize in books printed before 1900.  He produced a copy of the legendary work by Sonia Delaunay.  La Prose du Transsiberien.  This copy had never been assembled, and the sheets and the vellum binding, which had been hand painted by Delaunay herself, were still flat, and in pristine condition.  This made it one of the most desirable copies of one of the most sought-after books of the twentieth century.  It is now in a private collection in America. \nQ:  Why do you think books are important in our time of digital media?\nA:  Books are more important now than ever.  They are the physical manifestations of everything which makes up our civilization.  Of course, information is available digitally, but the physical book is about so much more than information.  Just as talking to a loved one on the phone or by Skype cannot be compared to being in their presence, so the physical book cannot be compared to its digital equivalent. \nQ:  What has been the biggest challenge you have experienced in rare book dealing?\nA:  The biggest challenge has been the internet.  Prior to that, knowledge, quality of stock, professionalism, and location, were the things which made the difference.  All that changed overnight.  Now everyone is an expert, ignorance is bliss, and to a degree, anarchy reigns.  Survival for me, and not just my position in the trade, now depends on the four things listed above.  But the internet means that the advantages I would have had just from being in the trade for 50 years have been erased. \nQ:  What is your proudest moment of rare book dealing?\nA:  My proudest moment as a rare book dealer was when my uncle, not one to praise anyone lightly, told me that he was proud of me, about ten years after I had left him to start my own business.  There was certainly never anyone else whose opinion I valued more.\nQ:  What is the best advice you've been given?\nA:  I was lucky enough to receive tremendous amounts of advice, and help from my elders and betters.  Dealers such as my uncle, Otto Ranschburg, Jake Zeitlin, and Pierre Beres to name just a few, and I think the one piece of advice which they all gave me, was to always try and buy the finest copies.  Always try and go for the best.  And I would still give that advice to anyone dealing or collecting today.\n\nFull text of a 2013 interview with prior owner, Peter Kraus taken from http://eidolonhouse.com/chronicles/2013/12/7/profile-of-a-rare-book-dealer-peter-kraus\nQ:  Tell me about yourself, even a brief history about how you became a rare book dealer.\nA:  I was born in England.

Baker Service Award recipients\n\nIn addition to images of the Ramayana, the Carlos Museum is also building a collection of Indian miniature paintings that depict the ten avatars of Vishnu.  The word avatar comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “descent” and refers to when a deity manifests in an earthly embodiment.  In this scene, the demon king Bali had conquered the gods, driving out Indra, king of the god’s heaven.  To vanquish Bali, the god Vishnu descended to earth as Vamana, the fifth avatar depicted as a dwarf-like Brahmin religious student.  To honor the Brahmin student, Bali asked him what he would like as a gift, and Vamana requested, “only as much land as his short legs could cover in three steps.”  However, as Bali completed the request, Vamana grew to an enormous size, transforming into the giant Trivikrama (“Conqueror of the Three Worlds”) and took three steps.  With the first two steps he encompassed the earth, the middle world, and the heavens, returning them to Indra’s rule.  There being nothing left to claim with his final step, Bali, finally recognizing that he was dealing with Vishnu, offered his own head.  Trivikrama then used the pressure of his foot to send Bali to the netherworld.\n\nVamana Avatar of Vishnu Transforms into Trivikrama with Mahabali Touching his Feet and the Gods Showering Blessings from Above\nIndia, Pahari, ca. 1830-1840\nGouache with gold on paper\nGift of Sally and Joe Gladden in honor of Drs.

To honor the Brahmin student, Bali asked him what he would like as a gift, and Vamana requested, “only as much land as his short legs could cover in three steps.”  However, as Bali completed the request, Vamana grew to an enormous size, transforming into the giant Trivikrama (“Conqueror of the Three Worlds”) and took three steps.  With the first two steps he encompassed the earth, the middle world, and the heavens, returning them to Indra’s rule.  There being nothing left to claim with his final step, Bali, finally recognizing that he was dealing with Vishnu, offered his own head.  Trivikrama then used the pressure of his foot to send Bali to the netherworld.\n\nVamana Avatar of Vishnu Transforms into Trivikrama with Mahabali Touching his Feet and the Gods Showering Blessings from Above\nIndia, Pahari, ca. 1830-1840\nGouache with gold on paper\nGift of Sally and Joe Gladden in honor of Drs.

Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs.  The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC.\n3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.  Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs.  The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence.\n5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC.  Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware.  Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.  More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5)\n11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration.  Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed.\n12. These figurines, found throughout the Persian Empire from Iran to the Levant, are often called ¿Persian riders¿ since their headgear, consisting of a hat covering the chin and cheeks, was the national headdress of the Persians.\n1.

Blackwares are found throughout the indigenous Americas, past and present. The process of making them in San Ildefonso, like the unusually slipped 3 by renowned potter Than Tsideh, is more elaborate: after forming, it was burnished (polished), then painted with a matte slip and fired. Those from Santa Clara, by contrast, are generally carved (1, 2, 4). Once the pot is formed it is left to harden, then the design is carved into the distinctive thick walls. The wedding vase by Phyllis and Marlin Hemlock (1) features the Avanyu, a Tewa serpent divinity associated with water and lightning.\nThe miniature pot by Dolores Curran (4) also features Avanyu, but utilizes the sgraffito technique. An increasingly popular method among Santa Clara potters, the design is lightly carved for greater detail but lesser visibility. The team of artists calling themselves Nana-kaa, meaning “Aspen Leaves,” also lightly sketch in a spider and her web (2). The spider is an important figure in Native American mythology, representing creativity, wisdom, and culture, who claims “I am a small thing, perhaps a scornful thing, my only power is wisdom. I am your culture, which can stand on your shoulder and whisper in your ear when you need advice.” Spider’s natural weaving ability also connects her with all arts, such as basketry and textiles. Here Nana-kaa has drawn attention to her by means of an inset turquoise cabochon.\n1.

The deluxe edition was illustrated profusely with engravings and colored plates taken from earlier landmark works.  This particular engraving was copied from the Description de l'Egypte, the massive survey made by the artists and scientists who had accompanied Napoleon to Egypt in 1798.

Accounts of its wonders date back to the Greek historian Herodotus in the fifth century BCE.  Following Augustus Caesar's defeat of Anthony and Cleopatra, the citizens of ancient Rome indulged in a fashionable craze for all things Egyptian, and numerous works of art were carried back to the city.  During the Renaissance the revival of interest in antiquity extended to Egypt as well as Greece and Rome.  Toward the end of the sixteenth century the popes began to re-erect the obelisks that had been brought to the city in ancient times.  By the early eighteenth century a few European explorers were making the first tentative voyages to the land of the Nile. \nWhile Giovanni Battista Piranesi never visited Egypt, he was fascinated with the Egyptian artifacts that had been in Rome since antiquity, and his etchings made them known to a broader public.  The systematic exploration and representation of Egypt's antiquities began in earnest, however, when Napoleon Bonaparte included not only soldiers but also the savants, 165 artists and scholars, among his invasion forces in 1798.  They published their findings in a multi-volume work, the Description de l'Egypte (1809-13).   Other illustrated accounts of scientific expeditions soon followed, and these works were studied with increasing curiosity by audiences in Europe and America.\nIn response to this mounting interest, artists began to travel to Egypt on their own in search of intriguing new subject matter.  On their respective journeys David Roberts and Frederick Arthur Bridgman both gathered a trove of archaeological and atmospheric material that was to serve them throughout their later careers.  As shown in the work of David Henry, Egypt maintains its attraction for artists down to the present day.\n\nThose who are trained or work in hygiene.\n\nJanuary 1993 descriptor added.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jargon bias.

Radical artistic and religious changes mark the reign of his son and successor, the “heretic” pharaoh Akhenaten (1353–1336 BC) and his queen, Nefertiti, who established a new capital at the site of Tell el-Amarna. During the Amarna Period, the cult of the royal family grew, in part to replace the other deities that had been proscribed. The king was now the intermediary between the sun god, Aten, and the worshipping Egyptians. Even images of the royal children could embody such concepts as fertility and rebirth. Following this turbulent period, Tutankhamun (1332–1322 BC) and his successors, Ay and Horemheb, returned the court to Thebes and reinstated the worship of the traditional pantheon.\n1.

Direct and indirect contacts with these cultures influences much of the history and cultural development of the Levant.  The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan.\n1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired.  The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving.  Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2).  This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan.\n304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter's wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes.  Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. \n5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean.  ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters.  Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware  Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline.\n8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age.  Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles.  These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles.\n10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age.  Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris.  Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin.  Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant.\n18.  This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age.  The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes.  Used as cult objects, these figurines were a schematic representation of a female deity and throne and reflect a Mycenaean religious heritage that was preserved by the Philistines.\n14-15.  These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan.  At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture.  Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire.  Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period.  A large proportion of the pottery (17) was simply painted in a fashion local to the region and northern Arabia.\n21. During the 7th century BC a system of marked and plain dome-shaped weights came into use in the Levant.  The different sized weights were based on the shekel, averaging 11.4 grams, and were used for weighing payment in the form of silver ingots for trade transactions.\n1. Amphoriskos.  Levant.

Over the next two centuries, Greek cities on the mainland, islands, and coast of Asia Minor founded colonial settlements throughout the Mediterranean. These sought to improve the standards of living at home by providing trading posts and sometimes access to agricultural land. The breath-taking ambition and scale of this undertaking is illustrated by the nearby map.\n\nTwo transformative developments occurred as part of this phenomenon. From the Levantine coast during the 8th century, the Greeks adopted the Semitic alphabet,\nand the practice of writing, long lost, was reborn. And in Ionia, the world¿s first coinage (1¿2) was invented to facilitate exchange, along with standardized weights (3).\n\nInclement winter conditions meant that the Greeks traded only during the warmer months. Especially in the summer, the prevailing wind was northerly: hence several personifications of one of the sons of Boreas, the north wind (4).\n\nTrade led to the transfer of ideas. The motif of Mistress or Master of the Wild Animals, in which a male or female holds up apparently tame, docile wild animals, can be traced far back in the Ancient Near East, for instance on this neo-Assyrian gem (5) or the Luristan finial (6). From there, it is possible to chart its progress to Crete (7), and the Persian Empire (8).\n\n1. Half-stater (Coin) Depicting a Lion¿s Head\nLydia, after Alyattes, ca. 610 BC. Electrum.\nGift of H.

Thus, many images of animals contain human traits—2 and 4 have human almond-shaped eyes. Another important assumption is that all phenomena relate in a series of analogies, often based on visual or functional similarities. Thus, animals can stand for humans (a carnivorous bird for a warrior, 2), and the animal food chain mirrors the human social hierarchy (a jaguar is above an ocelot, 4, as an experienced shaman is above a novice). This was a metaphoric equivalence (a shaman is a crocodile) not a simile (the shaman is like a crocodile). Shamanic experience includes humans freely becoming animals in a direct understanding of the unity of nature.\nThe animal that is most analogous to human is a monkey (3), here resting its sleeping head on a vessel. The puma head vessel (5) is likewise treated like a high-status human, as the vast majority of Moche portrait head vessels depict important men. Pumas are\nassociated with the highlands, whereas the Moche lived mostly on the coast. Thus, the exotic top feline of the mountains was elevated by portrayal in this format.\nExamples of the social analogy with the natural food chain are the osprey with his fish prey (2), and the ocelot (4) with a rope around his neck as if captive (human captives are shown in this way). His human eyes also suggest he is a shaman in animal form.\nSince the ocelot is a small version of a jaguar—ocelots have open spots, as here—this subservient treatment makes sense.\nHowever, the composition that juxtaposes barn owl, strombus shell trumpet, and boa contains interesting paradoxes. Owls do not eat snakes, nor do they carry shells on their backs. Thus, it seems to be a symbolic image, representing war, shamanic ritual, perhaps both, since shell trumpets were blown before either event. Animals also combine with other animals independent of humans: 6 is both toad (eyes, mouth, body) and cat (ears, nose, and paws). Using modern traditional peoples as clues to the past, many Amazonian peoples believe animals have their own shamans. Thus, a cat might become a toad.

Arnett\n\n2006 label for permanent collection gallery:\nMaya Shell, Clay & Stone\n\nThe Maya worked in Spondylus shell (1), clay (8-12), and stone, including jadeite and its close relatives (2-7). These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey.\n\nSpondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red  color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean. This type of open-centered earspool is typical of the Maya (4, 7) and represents a flower. The earspool would have been held in place by a central bead strung on a string that went through the hole in the earlobe, with more beads behind the earlobe serving as a counterweight.\n\nMaya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9, 10) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 11, 12). Like the painted pieces, a calligraphic line governs the fine incisions on 9 and 10, and delicate features are sculpted on the figurines. The latter are actually musical instruments: the mother and child (8) is a whistle, and the two standing females are rattles (11, 12).\n\nGreen stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Even their teeth were inlaid with dots of green (3). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. The pendant is a particularly fine piece, combining a harpy eagle with a human skull. This piece was actually found in Costa Rica, reflecting the practice of trading (or perhaps stealing) jades and recarving them.\n\n1.  Spondylus Shell Earspool.  Mesoamerica, Maya.

The term “art-tool” encompasses the assumption that the elaborate, intentional, and beautiful object performs an important action, or is based on a tool. The cosmos was conceived of as completely animate, as reinforced by the shamanic visionary experience that revealed the life force in all phenomena. Thus, the more active an artwork, the more it reflected universal law. Function and artistry therefore were complementary.\nTextile tools were highly elaborated and symbolically meaningful. Spindles—smooth tapered sticks that helped in the spinning of thread— were often painted (2–5), wound with unspun cotton (3) to secure carved and colorful whorls (4, 5), pierced disks that allowed thread to pile up on the spindle (8–22). Ancient American art does not always require an audience; its essential nature is more important, another reflection of the life force in all things.\nColombian spindle whorls (16–21) were carved with geometric patterns on the underside. Likewise, Aztec whorls were carved underneath with motifs such as flowers (8, 9), sun disks (10, 11) and high-status frets (14, 15). The individuality of these beautiful tools was marked: the ones with flowers may well denote their specific owners, since in the ritual calendar a birthday that augured well for an artist included a number and the sign of Flower. Thus “3 Flower” and “4 Flower” were likely women spinner’s names, and these their personal art-tools.\nThe most complex art-tools are battens, pointed bars used to pick up threads to produce complex patterns or beat down the last row of weaving to make a tight cloth. A Mixtec carved bone batten shows how a weaving tool may carry an intricate scene. Two figures face each other in the center, one with a spiral speech scroll to show talking to the other.\nMany such art-tools were buried during the Mixtec occupation of Monte Alban, indicating that important women—who were the weavers in that and most ancient American cultures—took their stories with them in this symbolic form. When buried with important men, carved battens may indicate funereal gifts from such high-status women. They may also indicate that among the Mixtec the metaphor of creation, rebirth, and the social “fabric” was carried by cloth and its production, as occurs worldwide. \nWomen in the ancient Andes have been found buried with the “tools of the trade” for spinning, weaving, and embroidery—their workbaskets (23) and boxes (24). These were filled with combs to align fibers for spinning, spindles for making and containing thread, balls of finished and dyed yarn, and small bowls used to keep the ends of the spindles contained while making fine thread. These items, especially when blue and green thread is found (colors made with the challenging indigo dyeing process), demonstrate an accomplished weaver was laid to rest with this assemblage. A fancy carved wooden box was likely also used by a high-status\nwoman. Taking their workbaskets with them to the afterlife bespeaks not only how important a role weaving was during life, but how the Andean cyclical worldview meant that women expected to continue to weave during the next life as well.\n1.

The text accompanying the illustration describes ¿the scene by the sea-side-the dolce far niente-the hunt for crustacea-the hour spent in sketching the distant schooner-the delightful tetes-a-tetes-are they not all written in our memories?¿  This pastiche is well-fitted to the miscellaneous incidents collected in Homer's picture.\n\nWinslow Homer in Print intro text:\nWINSLOW HOMER IN PRINT\n\nWinslow Homer (1836-1910), one of the greatest of America's nineteenth-century artists, launched his career in 1857 as a freelance illustrator for popular magazines.  For the most part Homer's illustrations featured imagery with a broad appeal for the audiences of  such publications as Harper's Weekly.  Close examination of the illustrations, however,  reveals the lines of development in his art as a whole.  In the years before the Civil War Homer portrayed scenes crowded with figures and anecdotal details.  His work as a correspondent at the front during the war brought a change not only in subject matter, but also in style.  Scenes of the war came to be more sharply focused, with incidental details trimmed away to give a more dramatic effect.  \nIn the years following the war this clarity was carried over to new subjects.  The simplified, yet sophisticated compositions lent charm and elegance to Homer's depiction of people, particularly women and children, engaged in leisure pursuits in the countryside and at the seashore.   The perils of the sea and the human struggle for survival-subjects which foreshadow Homer's later, greatest paintings-began to appear in the illustrations of the 1870s.  In these years the artist began to concentrate on painting in watercolor and in oil, reworking the motifs of the paintings in his magazine illustrations in order to make his more serious work known to a wider audience.  Finally, in 1875 Homer abandoned the field of illustration altogether to support himself solely by his painting.  \nWood engraving was the predominant method of mass production of images for illustration for magazines in the nineteenth century before the advent of photographic processes in the 1880s.  Artists like Homer executed their designs directly onto a wood block which had been polished and coated with white.  The block was then given to an engraver employed by the publisher, who carved away the bare white parts of the surface with a graver, a small sharpened steel rod.  Cutting across the end grain of the wood made possible finely detailed lines.  The lines drawn by the artist were left in relief, to be printed like type.  The blocks were then inked and sent through the press to create multiple copies of the original design.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias and jargon bias.

However, Robert Farris Thompson has documented stylistically similar twins in Ogbomoso.\"\"\n\nDivine Intervention label:\nTwin Memorial Figure (Ere Ibeji)\nAccording to the Yoruba peoples of Nigeria, twins share a single soul. If one twin dies the living twin is in danger of following it. In the event of a twin¿s death, the parents consult an Ifa diviner, who may decide that a ere ibeji should be carved as a substitute for the deceased child, though today photographs often replace carvings. The ibeji houses the soul for the benefit of the living soul by re-establishing the unity of the two. By caring for the ibeji, the family keeps the deceased child¿s spirit happy in the afterlife and ensures that the living twin does not die in order to join its deceased half. In the event that both twins should die a pair of ibeji is carved in the hope that, by caring for and pleasing the deceased twins, their souls will be reborn and live to adulthood (4¿5).\n\nThough associated with individual deceased children, ere ibeji are not portraits. The ibeji seen here exhibit Yoruba notions of adult beauty and moral virtue. Smooth surfaces, decorative scarification marks and elaborate hair patterns denote a healthy and fully socialized adult. Physical perfection is evident in the figure¿s youthful appearance and sexually mature features. The erect bearing of each statue indicates moral intelligence and mental alertness. The hands held to the sides and the firm stances of the feet give the figure a respectful attitude that indicates good character. Beads, metal bracelets, and cowrie shell jackets are added by the mother to protect and honor the deceased child (2¿3). Carved triangular pendants on the chest and back of (2) represent leather amulets (tirah) that hold quotations from the Islamic holy book, the Qur¿an. Tirah protect the soul of the twin residing within, whether the family owning the ibeji is a follower of Islam or not. The carved wrist and anklets represent brass bracelets for the orisha (deity) Aro, who defends children from the calls of abiku (spirit-children born to die). \n\nOnce the ere ibeji is carved, it is consecrated, an act that transforms the artist¿s work into an efficacious intermediary and vessel for the child¿s spirit (emi). The figure is soaked in a medicine of leaves and water, and palm oil and shea butter are rubbed into its surface. Ibeji are then placed on family altars and are bathed, dressed, rubbed with camwood and indigo, fed, taken to the market place, and played with, just as living children would be.

Cellulose nitrate is readily soluble in acetone.  Acryloid B72 and acrylic paints can be removed easily with acetone or toluene.\n\nTHE MOAB SURVEY\n\nSherds collected on the surface and around the edges of an ancient ruin reflect its occupational history. The pottery sherds above (1) were collected at a site known today as Khirbet el-Hawiyyah. Although Khirbet el-Hawiyyah has not been excavated and its ancient name is unknown, these sherds indicate that it was occupied off and on from pre-historic times through the Ottoman period. Archaeologists are often able to recognize sherds by comparing them to broken pieces of ceramic vessels found in other excavations. The sherds above represent broken forms used during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2900-2300 B.C.), Iron Age (ca. 1200-300 B.C.), Nabatean (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 100), and Late Islamic (ca. A.D. 1200-1900) periods.\n\nArchaeological surveys are conducted with close attention to the results of excavations in and near the regions surveyed. While the excavations provide ceramic control for the surveys, the surveys shed light on the general environment and the settlement patterns of the region in which the  sites are located. One of the difficulties encountered by the Emory University team in its survey of the Kerak plateau is that relatively few ruins have been excavated in southern Jordan. The map to the left locates the main excavated sites in relation to the survey area and the vessels displayed above are from three of these sites:\n\t\nBab edh-Dhra' (2, 3) is located approximately 1000 meters below the Kerak plateau on the eastern edge of the Lisan peninsula.  Excavated by American archaeologists beginning in 1965, it proved to be the remains of a city which flourished during the Early Bronze Age. Vessels (2, 3) displayed above are from the Bab edh-Dhra' cemetery and can be dated specifically to the Early Bronze II-III periods, approximately the time that the Great Pyramids were under construction in Egypt.  The ancient name of the city is unknown (Bab edh-Dhra' is the modern Arabic name of the ruin) and there are no written records to tell us of the people who lived there. However, we know from the material remains, such as the two vessels displayed above, that they appreciated artistic beauty.\t\n\nBuseirah (4, 5), excavated by British archaeologists under the direction of C. M. Bennett from 1971-1974, has provided well-preserved ceramic forms from the Iron Age when this was the chief city of the Edomites.  The modern Arabic name, Buseirah, preserves the ancient Edomite name, Bozrah.  The Edomites and Bozrah are known from the Hebrew Bible.  The two vessels from Buseirah/Bozrah displayed above (9, 10) date from Iron Age II (ca. 900-300 B.C.).\n \nEl-Lejjun (6, 7), on the eastern (desert) side of the Kerak plateau, has long been identified as Betthorus, mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum as the base camp of a Roman-Byzantine legion (legio IV Martia) during the late fourth century A.D. An American team directed by S. Thomas Parker began excavations at el-Lejjun in 1982 and, with excavations still underway, has uncovered stratified remains from the Late Roman through the Byzantine periods.  The two lamps displayed above (6,7) are from Early Byzantine (4th-5th centuries A.D.) contexts, by which time the Roman Empire had divided into West and East, dominated by Rome and Byzantium (Constantinople) respectively.\n\n1.

Kirdi women began to make beaded aprons during the early 20th century when European beads were introduced to northern Cameroon by Fulani traders. The cowrie shells that make up the fringe of each apron were imported from the East African coast. Bold, multi-hued, geometric patterns exemplify the 'Kirdi' apron style.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "I am a bias detector for museum artifact"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify all biases in the following text entry: Seated Male Figure\t\"Handbook Entry:\n\"\" West Mexican art principally concerns the connections between people, living to living as well as living to dead.  This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth's surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.  Thus, the sculptures safely and symbolically contradicted that isolation by stressing the continued bonds between people in the two realms.  \"\"\n\nBlack lighting results:\nRight leg was broken; right knee a lighter color; everything else looks ok.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art \n\nLarge, well-made ceramic sculptures and vessels filled the tombs of ancient western Mexico and accompanied the dead on their afterlife journey. Male-female pairs (12, 13) and dogs (16) are the most common sculptural subjects. The images of matching couples reveal an interest in showing human connections, a logical concern when the living and the dead are separated. Dogs, loyal companions since they came over from Asia across the Bering Strait with the first Americans, are also reunited with their masters via clay effigies in burials. Well-made bowls with geometric patterns (14) or human faces (15) likely held food intended to feed the soul of the deceased.\n\nTiny architectural models in stone (8, 9), also placed in burials, seem to represent temples or monuments to the ancestors, which may explain the recumbent figure on the roof of 9. \n\nAn important trade item in early ancient Mesoamerica was obsidian, or volcanic glass (1-7). It was prized primarily for its razor-sharp edge (it is still employed today in some eye surgery). From weapons such as spear points (1, 2) to cutting tools such as knives (7), obsidian was the material of choice. With great skill, blades (4) could be chiseled off of cores (3, 5, 6), but the process of striking off a blade as thin and translucent as this one, prone to breaking, was difficult to master. The Aztecs mounted such blades along the length of a club for a highly effective weapon. Some obsidian is naturally greenish (1) and was particularly prestigious and rare. \n\nIn Mesoamerican languages the word \"\"green\"\" also means \"\"precious.\"\" Utilitarian hand axes were  commemorated in greenstone ceremonial versions (10, 11). Too small to be useful for agricultural work, these fancy axes, known as celts, were found in many parts of Mesoamerica in early times. The form was highly influential southward in Costa Rica, where celts became highly elaborate and worn as necklaces.\n\n1.  Bifacial Pachua Obsidian Point.  Mesoamerica, West Mexico, Colima.

Witten II\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art\nAcross the world, early artistic statements often include female figurines (1–4) probably because pre-industrial societies rely heavily on women’s fertility for survival. This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. Having enough extra food was rare in ancient Mesoamerica, so body fat represented high status there as well. A protruding stomach and large navel (1), characterizing a woman who has given birth, were also prestigious. This figurine is also noteworthy because her arms move—thread looped through holes in the top of the arms and tied behind her neck hold them in various positions. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary.\nIn western Mexico ca. 200 BC to 300 AD clay effigies were sculpted, such as the seated couple (12, 13) and the dog (11). Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. Couples are common subjects, perhaps images of family to stay with the dead members in the afterlife. In any case, the idea of connection between dead and alive is expressed; the cyclical Amerindian worldview does not entirely distinguish between death and life. Dogs were not only earthly companions, but were fattened and consumed in this area, so clay canines symbolize afterlife sustenance as well. As elsewhere, dogs also were believed to guide souls into the Other Side.\nMoving eastward, early Guerrero art featured the Mezcala [mehz cah lah] stone carving style (7, 8). Small, finely ground images of structures, complete with staircases and doors, sometimes include prone figures on top (8). This suggests the elevation of the deceased in/on a temple, implying these were models put in the grave to honor the ancestor. Since life and death were interrelated, the deceased influenced affairs of the living, ensuring the rains, fertility, and so on.\nIn early Central Mexico highly skilled ceramicists hand built large and impressive vessels (5, 6, 9, 10) at the site of Chupícuaro [choo peek wahr oh]. Simple tripods refer to the evolution from baskets to clay containers by painting a diagonal pattern around the rim (5), depicting the spiral finishing of baskets’ tops. More elaborate geometric patterns also follow diagonal formats that defer to the constraints of basket weaving (6, 9, 10). Though no actual textiles survive from this region, we can infer the importance of the fiber arts throughout Mesoamerican antiquity.\n1.

From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination.  The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops.  Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds.  The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel.  The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period.\n1-7.  The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC.  The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base.\n8-10.  The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions.  The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle.  Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market.  Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms.\n23-32.  The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods.  In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23).  Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs.\n1,2. Four-Spouted Lamps.  Levant, Jericho, Tomb P24 and Tomb J28.

Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture. Honduran artists took the dancing figures and glyphs of Maya vessels and transformed them into repetitive graphic designs (12-14).

In some ways it related southward to Costa Rica, for instance, sharing a penchant for using clay stamps (1–3) to decorate the body. The central zone of Honduras, however, was quite independent of its neighbors, expressing itself artistically in a unique marble carving tradition (4, 6). Western Honduras lay in the ancient Maya sphere, part of Mesoamerica, with the great city of Copán at its heart. Certainly the artistic environment was rich in influences.\nThe famous Ulua marbles, named for a river valley in central Honduras, were carved from the only source of marble south of Georgia. Its ten or more quarries yielded specific colors, now grayed from age and perhaps being heated in rituals; 4 was scientifically tested and comes from the southernmost Quarry “1.” The small chip visible in 6 shows the white marble as it looked when the piece was made. The vessels’ designs feature fantastical feline handles, derived from earlier ceramic precedents (5), and surfaces carved with repeating snakehead patterns. Like steam or smoke, spirals twist and turn all around them, evoking the typically reported visions in which wise spirit snakes advise shamans.\nMany Honduran ceramics relate to the Maya styles they encountered during the extensive mutual trade between the two peoples (Honduran chocolate for Maya salt). Tall straightsided cylinders are favored Maya chocolate vessel forms, though in Honduran versions the proportions are considerably widened and feet or ring bases (11) may be added. Designs sometimes stick close to Maya ones, such as the feather-bedecked person in 12, or feature Mayoid figures but veer into illegibility (7) and decorative repetition (8). References to Maya rim glyphs occur (11, 12), but are fanciful riffs on the prestigious foreign writing.\nBirds may appear naturalistically, as in the cormorant successfully fishing (10) or more blended with humans in cartouches (11), the nods to the Maya becoming obscure. Honduran individuality is apparent in all these works, such as the charming matched pair of stamps depicting jaguar-human shamans (3).\n \n1. Monkey Figures Stamp\nCentral America, Honduras.

After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"\"bone\"\" and \"\"seed\"\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"\"immortal\"\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n\n1, 3.Negative-Painted Secondary Burial Urns.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nArt of Ancient Ecuador\nEcuador, between Colombia and Peru, is considered part of the Northern Andes in ancient times, though it was partly conquered by the Inka in the sixteenth century. It was a very creative area, making female figurines (2, 3) and weaving cloth on looms (represented by the skirt depicted in 6) well before adjacent regions. Some of its practices relate to the Colombian and lower Central American cultures, such as secondary burial in large urns (1, 7) and roller stamped body decoration (5). Secondary burial means the deceased was allowed to decompose and the bones placed in giant vessels, which were then buried on the anniversary of the death. The face painted on 7 suggests the reanimation of these permanent body parts on the Other Side; indeed, the word for “bone” is the word for “seed” in this area, expressing the idea that the bones will grow another person.\nMany distinct styles followed one another in Ecuador, from the early expressive Chorrera [cho rare rah] (4, 8) dated 700–300 bc, to the later, delicate Jama-Coaque [hah mah co wa kay] (6). The seated Chorrera figure (8) shuts his eyes, holds his mirror necklace, and displays quids of coca in his cheeks, all indications that he is a shaman in trance (mirrors were divination tools and coca was used to maintain consciousness for lengthy rituals). The standing Jama-Coaque female effigy (6) represents a high-status woman in a turban, wrapped skirt, and gold jewelry. The clay slabs standing for cloth draping between her head and shoulders are impressive—clay dries at different rates and such suspended parts are prone to destruction from the moment they are created. Post-fired paint suggests the bright yellow headwrap and black skirt of a beautifully adorned young woman, whose arms show the imprint of patterns that may have been stamped, tattooed, or scarified on an actual person.\n1.

The figures dive downwards like caiman slithering\ninto a river and shamans flying into the Underworld. This position places their human aspects in shadow,\nintentionally privileging the animal over the human self.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nArt of Ancient Ecuador\nEcuador, between Colombia and Peru, is considered part of the Northern Andes in ancient times, though it was partly conquered by the Inka in the sixteenth century. It was a very creative area, making female figurines (2, 3) and weaving cloth on looms (represented by the skirt depicted in 6) well before adjacent regions. Some of its practices relate to the Colombian and lower Central American cultures, such as secondary burial in large urns (1, 7) and roller stamped body decoration (5). Secondary burial means the deceased was allowed to decompose and the bones placed in giant vessels, which were then buried on the anniversary of the death. The face painted on 7 suggests the reanimation of these permanent body parts on the Other Side; indeed, the word for “bone” is the word for “seed” in this area, expressing the idea that the bones will grow another person.\nMany distinct styles followed one another in Ecuador, from the early expressive Chorrera [cho rare rah] (4, 8) dated 700–300 bc, to the later, delicate Jama-Coaque [hah mah co wa kay] (6). The seated Chorrera figure (8) shuts his eyes, holds his mirror necklace, and displays quids of coca in his cheeks, all indications that he is a shaman in trance (mirrors were divination tools and coca was used to maintain consciousness for lengthy rituals). The standing Jama-Coaque female effigy (6) represents a high-status woman in a turban, wrapped skirt, and gold jewelry. The clay slabs standing for cloth draping between her head and shoulders are impressive—clay dries at different rates and such suspended parts are prone to destruction from the moment they are created. Post-fired paint suggests the bright yellow headwrap and black skirt of a beautifully adorned young woman, whose arms show the imprint of patterns that may have been stamped, tattooed, or scarified on an actual person.\n1.

Kirdi is the Fulani word for 'pagan,' and the term is often used to refer to small groups of people such as the Matakam, Margi, and Kapsiki, who retreated from Fulani slave raids and conversions to Islam during the 19th century by moving into the Mandara Mountains.  Kirdi women began to make beaded aprons during the early 20th century when European beads were introduced to northern Cameroon by Fulani traders. The cowrie shells that make up the fringe of each apron were imported from the East African coast. Bold, multi-hued, geometric patterns exemplify the 'Kirdi' apron style. The complex checkerboard compositions in 1,3, and 6 are based on international naval signal flags that were probably copied from a mission or school library book. Seven actual flag designs can be identified in 1, but flag patterns are also freely adapted to create innovative designs as seen in 3 and 6.

Its natural defenses and the availability of water made the site desirable as a citadel and dwelling place. It has been continuously inhabited\nsince Neolithic times, ca. 5000 bc. By the early sixth century bc it had become a sanctuary sacred to the goddess Athena. In 480 bc the Persians invaded Athens, and the Acropolis was overrun, its temples, dedications, and sculptures all\ndestroyed and burned. The monuments now visible on its summit are the remnants of a grand building scheme begun in the middle of the fifth century bc under the statesman Perikles, after the defeat of Persia and the rise of Athens to empire. From left to right on the summit are the Erechtheion, the Parthenon, the Propylaia, and the small temple of Athena Nike, all constructed between 447 and 404 bc in white\nmarble quarried from Mount Pentelicon northeast of Athens. The dark tower just to the left of the temple of Athena Nike is the so-called Frankish Tower, built by a Florentine family, the Acciaiuoli, who ruled as Dukes of Athens from the late\nfourteenth century until the Ottoman conquest in 1458.\n\nThe Eye of Greece intro text:\nThe Eye of Greece\nAthens in Nineteenth-Century Photographs\nWhen the English poet John Milton called Athens ¿the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts and Eloquence¿ in Paradise Regained (1671), he echoed the opinion of untold generations who had looked on the city as the center of culture and civilization ever since its rise to greatness under the statesman Perikles in the fifth century bc. It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\nFive years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.\n\nObjects in Lot 1:\n1985.023.011\nX.0019.001\nX.0019.005\nX.0019.006\nX.0019.007\nX.0019.008\nX.0019.009\nX.0019.011\nX.0019.013\nX.0019.016\nX.0019.017\nX.0019.018\nX.0019.019\nX.0019.020\nX.0019.021\nX.0019.026\nX.0019.027\nX.0019.029\nX.0019.032\nX.0019.033\nX.0019.035\nX.0019.036\nX.0019.037\nX.0019.041\nX.0019.046\nX.0019.047\nX.0019.048\nX.0019.049\nX.0019.052\nX.0019.053\nX.0019.054\nX.0019.055\nX.0019.056\nX.0019.058\nX.0019.060\nX.0019.062\nX.0019.063\nX.0019.064\nX.0019.065\nX.0019.066\nX.0019.070 A/B\n\nNo provenance information in files.\","}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias.

(IVa? -- in original concept, this would have been a small b/w photo) \"\"\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nGender in Costa Rican Art  \n\nBoth sexes figure prominently in ancient Costa Rican art, even within the same piece (1, 5). Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). \n\nImages that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have fit into the ring above their heads). Likewise, in 5, a large oval metate (grinding platform), the women form the legs that support the plate, most likely used for making maize into flour. Their hands rest on their bellies in a gesture of fertility (perhaps one of the messages of the piece being that the maize food nourishes the generations of mothers and children). Female images made into vessels (4) also explicitly combine human fertility (her navel is everted as in pregnancy) with plentiful food. The woman as a vessel for life is aptly conveyed. \n\nThe tiny severed heads that encircle the metate's plate seem to represent the simultaneous giving and taking of life, in a probable analogy with the harvesting of maize kernels. Thus, through the metaphors of humans and maize the cycle of life itself is celebrated. The same kind of festive action in 1 may be related to the food stored in the pot above the dancers. Certainly in pre-industrial society a full food jar or a good harvest ready to be processed on a milling stone were key to survival and power. Men's and women's complementary contributions to this success were honored in ancient Costa Rican art.   \n\n1.  Pot Stand with Ring of Dancing Figures and Large Birds.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nWomb Vessels\nIn pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\nA bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \nThe other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\nAppliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\nOther images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual. These ideas of burying and digging up, the living accessing the other realms and the dead, reflect the deeply cyclical worldview of indigenous Amerindians.\n1.

The text accompanying the illustration describes ¿the scene by the sea-side-the dolce far niente-the hunt for crustacea-the hour spent in sketching the distant schooner-the delightful tetes-a-tetes-are they not all written in our memories?¿  This pastiche is well-fitted to the miscellaneous incidents collected in Homer's picture.\n\nWinslow Homer in Print intro text:\nWINSLOW HOMER IN PRINT\n\nWinslow Homer (1836-1910), one of the greatest of America's nineteenth-century artists, launched his career in 1857 as a freelance illustrator for popular magazines.  For the most part Homer's illustrations featured imagery with a broad appeal for the audiences of  such publications as Harper's Weekly.  Close examination of the illustrations, however,  reveals the lines of development in his art as a whole.  In the years before the Civil War Homer portrayed scenes crowded with figures and anecdotal details.  His work as a correspondent at the front during the war brought a change not only in subject matter, but also in style.  Scenes of the war came to be more sharply focused, with incidental details trimmed away to give a more dramatic effect.  \nIn the years following the war this clarity was carried over to new subjects.  The simplified, yet sophisticated compositions lent charm and elegance to Homer's depiction of people, particularly women and children, engaged in leisure pursuits in the countryside and at the seashore.   The perils of the sea and the human struggle for survival-subjects which foreshadow Homer's later, greatest paintings-began to appear in the illustrations of the 1870s.  In these years the artist began to concentrate on painting in watercolor and in oil, reworking the motifs of the paintings in his magazine illustrations in order to make his more serious work known to a wider audience.  Finally, in 1875 Homer abandoned the field of illustration altogether to support himself solely by his painting.  \nWood engraving was the predominant method of mass production of images for illustration for magazines in the nineteenth century before the advent of photographic processes in the 1880s.  Artists like Homer executed their designs directly onto a wood block which had been polished and coated with white.  The block was then given to an engraver employed by the publisher, who carved away the bare white parts of the surface with a graver, a small sharpened steel rod.  Cutting across the end grain of the wood made possible finely detailed lines.  The lines drawn by the artist were left in relief, to be printed like type.  The blocks were then inked and sent through the press to create multiple copies of the original design.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias and jargon bias.

The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site.  Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.  Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain.\nThe population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions.  Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy.\nGraves and burial offering provide most of our information about Jericho during the period.  Several generations of extended families or members of certain social groups used the same graves over long periods of time.  Burial chambers were hewn out of the stone faces of riverbeds, northeast of the city mound, and were generally used for multiple burials.  Pottery, jewelry and weapons were the most common goods deposited with the dead.\nJericho's Early Bronze Age town flourished until the second half of the third millennium B.C. Along with other towns and cities in the Levant, Jericho was destroyed and temporarily abandoned.  The disruptions of the time may have been the result of drought, erosion, and deforestation as well as internal conflicts among the Levantine towns and cities.  Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho.\n1-4. Pottery, with its different shapes and decoration, is our primary source for understanding the cultural origins, foreign influences, and international connections for the people of Jericho.  These vessels represent one of the three pottery traditions at the site during the Proto-Urban period.  Called Proto-Urban A, this tradition consisted of handmade bowls and jugs that were covered with a burnished or polished red slip.  Parallels with similar pottery traditions in the Near East suggest the influence of people from Syria and Anatolia.\n5-8. Jewelry was a common offering in graves of men and women during the Proto-Urban period.  Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia.\n9. Although the period is called Early Bronze Age, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was virtually non-existent at Jericho.  Copper was sometimes used for certain tools and weapons including daggers or axeheads, but these objects were rarely deposited in tombs.  When the copper or bronze objects do appear in tombs, they are usually in the form of highly prized jewelry, rings, bracelets and beads.\n10-12. Animal bones with holes partially drilled into one end were deposited as offerings in some of the Early Bronze Age graves.  Though called by various names, including ¿idols¿, ¿dolls¿, or ¿cult objects¿, their function remains a mystery.\n13-24.  Pottery from the Early Bronze Age was essentially handmade, though parts of vessels were made on a simple potter's wheel.  Vessels were usually covered with a burnished red slip.  Shapes of the period included storage jars, cooking pots, deep kraters (mixing vessels for wine), jugs, juglets (16-22) and amphoriskoi (perfume or oil bottles).  Little juglets and amphoriskoi were used to store precious oils and small flat bowls (23) served as oil lamps.\n1,2. Bowls. Tomb K1.  Proto-Urban, 3300-3050 BC.  Clay.  1955.111, 89.\n3.

The two seem to have enjoyed a mutual admiration, since it is recorded that they exchanged collections of each other's prints when they met in the Netherlands in 1521.  Lucas, like Dürer, was known for his original choice of subjects, but his engravings display a more delicate tone and a softer atmosphere than Dürer's.   His work was also highly prized by both collectors and other artists.\n\nInvention and Revival into text:\nINVENTION AND REVIVAL: NORTHERN EUROPEAN PRINTS\n\nPrints are meant to be propagated.  Artists carve wooden blocks or incise metal plates in order to make multiple impressions on paper of their designs, their inventions.  Printmaking is a field rich with possibilities for experimentation.  Artists are challenged to test the limits of the medium, to discover just how much can be expressed by making marks on wood or metal.   Once it leaves the workshop a print can travel far to win fame for the printmaker and to serve as a model for other artists.  Thus, experiments and inventions become a part of the history of printmaking, forming a tradition that succeeding printmakers will react to, revive, and reinvent.\n\t\nThere are two basic forms of print processes-relief and intaglio.  The woodcut is a relief process in which material is carved away from the lines of the design.  Engravings, etchings, and drypoints are all intaglio processes in which lines are cut into a copper plate from which impressions will be made.  In engraving a tool called a burin is used to gouge grooves directly into the plate.  Etching allows an artist to draw more freely, scratching with a needle through a ground of resin, gum, or wax that has been applied to the plate.  Once the design is complete the plate is bathed in acid which bites into the metal where the surface coating has been scraped away by the needle.  In drypoint the artist works directly on the plate with a very hard needle that throws up a rough burr of metal on either side of the drawn line. \n\nBoth woodcuts and engravings first appeared in Europe in Germany in the fifteenth century.  Having mastered woodcut and engraving, Albrecht Dürer also tried his hand at etching and drypoint, but did not systematically pursue his efforts.  Lucas van Leyden was the first artist to make etchings on copper plates and combined this process with engraving.

It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\nFive years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.\n\nApril 1993 descriptor moved.\n\nNo provenance information in files.\n\nCondition update provided to ROM for 2019 loan renewal.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jargon bias.

While the prospect of discovering submerged cities and sunken treasures has sparked the imagination of many through the ages, it is only in the last decades of this century that the systematic exploration of the depths of oceans and lakes has become feasible.  Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, have made possible the methodical exploration of underwater sites often less disturbed than those on land.  New sophisticated equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high sea crossing was customary.  Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity as well as of navigation which played such a crucial role in colonization ventures and international commerce. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples.  Objects in this case were recovered from a shipwreck off the Spanish coast, the island of Rhodes, as well as the ancient harbors of Syracuse and Caesarea.\nAlthough recovered off the Spanish coast, the shape of this amphora (storage vessel) (1) and its markings indicate that it came from Delos and belonged to a wealthy, local merchant.  The islands of Delos and Rhodes, because of their geographical location, were major Mediterranean trading posts and had a large production of amphorae  (1, 2).  \nSyracuse (3, 4). During its work on the ancient harbor of Syracuse (Sicily) in 1962, the Link expedition uncovered remains of a sixth century A.D. cemetery and the remains of a ship loaded with marble columns intended for a Byzantine church. A vast quantity of artifacts bearing witness to natural calamities and military disasters such as the destruction of the Athenian fleet in the third century B.C was also found at the site.\nCaesarea (5-10).  Strategically located on the Syro-Palestinian coast, Caesarea (in modern day Israel) has a history of active trade since 3000 B.C.  In 10 B.C., Herod the Great built a new harbor-city on this site in honor of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus who gave his name to the city.  As the capital of Roman Palestine, Caesarea rivaled Jerusalem in importance and splendor.  Due to changes in the water level of the Mediterranean Sea, structures of the ancient harbor had been covered by water for centuries.  The objects on display were recovered from the submerged harbor and surrounding waters during the Link expedition to Caesarea and the Sea of Galilee of 1960.  During this expedition, Emory Professor Immanuel Ben Dor and Atlanta Artist George Beattie accompanied Edwin A. Link, a brilliant inventor, who designed innovative underwater exploration vessels.  His ship, the Sea Diver II, was equipped with metal detectors, electronic probes, and an underwater capsule, enabling prolonged diving periods at a depth of up to 400 feet.\n1.

Jericho's population constructed or re-used rock-cut tombs with shafts and subterranean chambers where furniture, mats, baskets, and wooden platters with food remains were found partially preserved. Pottery, jewelry, and other personal items, including alabaster jars for oil or perfume and scarab seals or amulets, were also left with the dead.\nTomb P1 was one of more than one hundred tombs discovered at Jericho dating to the later Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1800-1550 bc). Typical of the period in content and shape, Tomb P1 consisted of a vertical rock-cut shaft leading into a subterranean chamber. It measured 3.3 x 3.8 meters (10 3/4 x 12 1/2 feet) and was closed off by a large blocking stone. Although originally constructed during the previous period,\nthe tomb was reused by Jericho's Middle Bronze Age population.\nInside the chamber, archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon discovered twenty-four skeletons from five successive burial groups. The majority of the skeletons found\nwere those of adults, with only three children among them. To make space for each new burial, many of the bodies and burial offerings were pushed to the rear or\nsides of the chamber or were removed from the tomb altogether.\nBecause of the scattering of the tomb contents, it is impossible to associate particular offerings with specific individuals interred. The limited stylistic\nvariation of the pottery, however, suggests that the tomb was used for a relatively short period of time. Displayed in this case is the full range of artifacts\nexcavated from Tomb P1, except for a cooking pot and the charred remains of wooden stools and/or tables.

This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth's surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.  Thus, the sculptures safely and symbolically contradicted that isolation by stressing the continued bonds between people in the two realms.  \"\"\n\nBlack lighting results:\nRight leg was broken; right knee a lighter color; everything else looks ok.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art \n\nLarge, well-made ceramic sculptures and vessels filled the tombs of ancient western Mexico and accompanied the dead on their afterlife journey. Male-female pairs (12, 13) and dogs (16) are the most common sculptural subjects. The images of matching couples reveal an interest in showing human connections, a logical concern when the living and the dead are separated. Dogs, loyal companions since they came over from Asia across the Bering Strait with the first Americans, are also reunited with their masters via clay effigies in burials. Well-made bowls with geometric patterns (14) or human faces (15) likely held food intended to feed the soul of the deceased.\n\nTiny architectural models in stone (8, 9), also placed in burials, seem to represent temples or monuments to the ancestors, which may explain the recumbent figure on the roof of 9. \n\nAn important trade item in early ancient Mesoamerica was obsidian, or volcanic glass (1-7). It was prized primarily for its razor-sharp edge (it is still employed today in some eye surgery). From weapons such as spear points (1, 2) to cutting tools such as knives (7), obsidian was the material of choice. With great skill, blades (4) could be chiseled off of cores (3, 5, 6), but the process of striking off a blade as thin and translucent as this one, prone to breaking, was difficult to master. The Aztecs mounted such blades along the length of a club for a highly effective weapon. Some obsidian is naturally greenish (1) and was particularly prestigious and rare. \n\nIn Mesoamerican languages the word \"\"green\"\" also means \"\"precious.\"\" Utilitarian hand axes were  commemorated in greenstone ceremonial versions (10, 11). Too small to be useful for agricultural work, these fancy axes, known as celts, were found in many parts of Mesoamerica in early times. The form was highly influential southward in Costa Rica, where celts became highly elaborate and worn as necklaces.\n\n1.  Bifacial Pachua Obsidian Point.  Mesoamerica, West Mexico, Colima.

Witten II\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art\nAcross the world, early artistic statements often include female figurines (1–4) probably because pre-industrial societies rely heavily on women’s fertility for survival. This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. Having enough extra food was rare in ancient Mesoamerica, so body fat represented high status there as well. A protruding stomach and large navel (1), characterizing a woman who has given birth, were also prestigious. This figurine is also noteworthy because her arms move—thread looped through holes in the top of the arms and tied behind her neck hold them in various positions. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary.\nIn western Mexico ca. 200 BC to 300 AD clay effigies were sculpted, such as the seated couple (12, 13) and the dog (11). Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. Couples are common subjects, perhaps images of family to stay with the dead members in the afterlife. In any case, the idea of connection between dead and alive is expressed; the cyclical Amerindian worldview does not entirely distinguish between death and life. Dogs were not only earthly companions, but were fattened and consumed in this area, so clay canines symbolize afterlife sustenance as well. As elsewhere, dogs also were believed to guide souls into the Other Side.\nMoving eastward, early Guerrero art featured the Mezcala [mehz cah lah] stone carving style (7, 8). Small, finely ground images of structures, complete with staircases and doors, sometimes include prone figures on top (8). This suggests the elevation of the deceased in/on a temple, implying these were models put in the grave to honor the ancestor. Since life and death were interrelated, the deceased influenced affairs of the living, ensuring the rains, fertility, and so on.\nIn early Central Mexico highly skilled ceramicists hand built large and impressive vessels (5, 6, 9, 10) at the site of Chupícuaro [choo peek wahr oh]. Simple tripods refer to the evolution from baskets to clay containers by painting a diagonal pattern around the rim (5), depicting the spiral finishing of baskets’ tops. More elaborate geometric patterns also follow diagonal formats that defer to the constraints of basket weaving (6, 9, 10). Though no actual textiles survive from this region, we can infer the importance of the fiber arts throughout Mesoamerican antiquity.\n1.

These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey.\n\nSpondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red  color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean.

Arnett\n\n2006 label for permanent collection gallery:\nMaya Shell, Clay & Stone\n\nThe Maya worked in Spondylus shell (1), clay (8-12), and stone, including jadeite and its close relatives (2-7). These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey.\n\nSpondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red  color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean. This type of open-centered earspool is typical of the Maya (4, 7) and represents a flower. The earspool would have been held in place by a central bead strung on a string that went through the hole in the earlobe, with more beads behind the earlobe serving as a counterweight.\n\nMaya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9, 10) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 11, 12). Like the painted pieces, a calligraphic line governs the fine incisions on 9 and 10, and delicate features are sculpted on the figurines. The latter are actually musical instruments: the mother and child (8) is a whistle, and the two standing females are rattles (11, 12).\n\nGreen stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Even their teeth were inlaid with dots of green (3). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. The pendant is a particularly fine piece, combining a harpy eagle with a human skull. This piece was actually found in Costa Rica, reflecting the practice of trading (or perhaps stealing) jades and recarving them.\n\n1.  Spondylus Shell Earspool.  Mesoamerica, Maya.

Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts. Class consciousness can also be discerned in vessels that imitate high status examples (3).\nThe subjects may be expressively human, such as a gentle and genteel Maya mother with a child on her back (6, the baby’s head has broken off). They may relate to rulers, adding a profile face found on royal headdresses and scepters (5) to a container for drinking the high-status chocolate beverage kakaw. Further up the scale, some vessels concern deities: 2 represents the snakefooted god K’awil, patron of divination and rulership. Highly esoteric images include disembodied eyeballs interspersed with jaguar spots (4), perhaps a reference to the addition of entheogens to the kakaw and the dizzying visions of becoming a jaguar that result.\nSome pieces speak to issues we may not associate with preindustrial societies, including “art for art’s sake.” While most Maya ceramics depict recognizable imagery, 1’s subject is limited to the brushstroke itself, seemingly an instance of art about art. The elevated social status of the artist, usually just below royalty, apparently meant that at times aesthetics could be self-referential.\nThe social status hierarchy is also apparent in 3: while many chocolate vessels have hieroglyphs painted around the rim identifying the scene and/or the pot’s owner, here the generalized shapes in this position are actually only pretend writing. These “pseudo-glyphs” indicate that the owner had an artist, who presumably could not read glyphs either, come up with gibberish to impress others. A highly elaborated culture generates fine social distinctions, and rule breaking as well as following them.\n1. Bowl with Abstract Brushstroke Design\nMesoamerica, Peten, Guatemala, Maya.

Spotted cats may be shown with the body as the bowl itself (1, 2, 6), may carry a bowl on the back (4, 5, 7), or may perch on a bowl that is portrayed as something else, such as a tree (3). Jaguars are skilled tree climbers, so 3 is not fantastical in any way.\n\nIn all these pieces, the feline's body is painted or incised to suggest spots, even though some appear to be stripes. There are no tigers in the Americas; however, the lower limbs and chest of a jaguar may appear somewhat striped, as smaller rosettes can fuse into lines, therefore a striped cat may still represent a jaguar. Other spotted felines existed in Costa Rica (margays, ocelots, and others), but jaguars are by far the largest and most impressive (an ocelot's weight is one-tenth that of a jaguar). A vessel like 7, with ears more pointed than rounded, may well represent a smaller feline, however.\n\nThe bowl may serve to hold the incense in an incense burner (4, 5), in which case the jaguar figure below acts as the legs. In this same Potosi style crocodilians perch on incense burner lids. There may be a distinction being drawn between the crocodile as the earth's surface, a widespread ancient American belief, and the jaguar as the king of the Underworld, also a broadly held idea. Jaguars are largely nocturnal, their spots resemble reversed stars, and they are avid swimmers, so the associations with the dark, wet night of the Underworld are strong. Given this cosmic structure, it would be natural to place jaguars below and crocodiles above in incense burner compositions.\n\nBy analogy with the Potosi examples, 5 may also be the base of a small incense burner. The pieces in which the bowl is the body (1, 2, 6) could have held almost anything, or nothing at all, in rituals or the burial. The prevalent belief in shamanism that all things are alive, including art, means that a vessel is complete even when empty. It may also have been envisioned to contain the ephemeral spirit of whatever it portrayed, in this instance the spirit of the jaguar, which is often considered the shaman's animal self.\n\n1.\tRectangular Bowl with Modeled Jaguar Heads.

There were, however, many settlements in existence along the Nile valley. Most of these are known today less from their living sites than from their cemeteries that were situated in the Upper Egyptian desert and are thus easily accessible to archaeologists.\n\nThe dead were buried in a contracted position in shallow pits dug in the sand and were surrounded by grave goods consisting of pots, which probably contained food and drink, and personal items like cosmetic palettes. These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n\nThe preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n\t\nSlate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period. They were used for grinding various ores, such as galena (lead sulphide) or malachite (copper carbonate) in order to produce eye make-up, which was worn by both men and women. \n\t\nFinely finished pottery in red and black was characteristic of the Upper Egyptian predynastic and formed part of an African ceramic tradition that continues through the present day. \n\n\n1.

Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found all over the Near East from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India's Indus River valley and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia.  Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive ¿intercultural style¿ with geometric (1-3) and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes wit hattacking felines (7), bulls (5, 6) and entwined serpents (4, 7).  More examples of ¿intercultural style¿ vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East.  Such large numbers of vessel finds implies that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels; or, it may have been one of the first stops and a major customer on a trade route running between the southern Iranian plateau, the main source area of chlorite, and Mesopotamia.  The vessels were considered luxury products.  Though they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined cist tombs.\n9. This sandstone head was found near al-'Ula (ancient Dedan), one of the most important oases of Northern Arabia and an important caravan stop on the incense route that went from Yemen to the Levant.  Originally part of a statue, this head may be associated with a Lihyanite sanctuary at the side dating to the fourth through third centuries BC, where similar male statues, perhaps representing deities, have been found.  The Lihyans, a tribe who controlled the oasis after the fall of the kingdom of Dedan, left a considerable number of inscriptions in the region naming at least eight of their kings and the names of numerous gods and goddesses including the chief deity, Dhu-Ghabat.\n1-3.

This sandstone head was found near al-'Ula (ancient Dedan), one of the most important oases of Northern Arabia and an important caravan stop on the incense route that went from Yemen to the Levant.  Originally part of a statue, this head may be associated with a Lihyanite sanctuary at the side dating to the fourth through third centuries BC, where similar male statues, perhaps representing deities, have been found.  The Lihyans, a tribe who controlled the oasis after the fall of the kingdom of Dedan, left a considerable number of inscriptions in the region naming at least eight of their kings and the names of numerous gods and goddesses including the chief deity, Dhu-Ghabat.\n1-3.

Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). \n\nImages that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have fit into the ring above their heads). Likewise, in 5, a large oval metate (grinding platform), the women form the legs that support the plate, most likely used for making maize into flour. Their hands rest on their bellies in a gesture of fertility (perhaps one of the messages of the piece being that the maize food nourishes the generations of mothers and children). Female images made into vessels (4) also explicitly combine human fertility (her navel is everted as in pregnancy) with plentiful food. The woman as a vessel for life is aptly conveyed. \n\nThe tiny severed heads that encircle the metate's plate seem to represent the simultaneous giving and taking of life, in a probable analogy with the harvesting of maize kernels. Thus, through the metaphors of humans and maize the cycle of life itself is celebrated. The same kind of festive action in 1 may be related to the food stored in the pot above the dancers. Certainly in pre-industrial society a full food jar or a good harvest ready to be processed on a milling stone were key to survival and power. Men's and women's complementary contributions to this success were honored in ancient Costa Rican art.   \n\n1.  Pot Stand with Ring of Dancing Figures and Large Birds.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nWomb Vessels\nIn pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\nA bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \nThe other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\nAppliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\nOther images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual. These ideas of burying and digging up, the living accessing the other realms and the dead, reflect the deeply cyclical worldview of indigenous Amerindians.\n1.
